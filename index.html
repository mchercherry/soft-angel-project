        <h2>SAP's Conception</h2>
        <p>SAP (<span>Soft Angel Project</span>) was officially founded in 1941, but the discovery of cannies can be traced back to 1919. An unidentifiable creature was found miles away from a military base, with a nest spread across a 10 mile radius. While probing the suspected nest yielded no identification nor further signs of life, this first creature (affectionately called an <span>angel</span> by an on-sight private) revealed a world wide phenomena several countries were beginning to endure. Dubbed "cannies" for their human-like qualities, our program seeks to solve the <span>Great Canny Mystery</span>.</p>

        <h2>Cannies In America</h2>
        <p>SAP™ has now officially had 4 encounters with American-found cannies. It is not clear how these creatures connect to one another, if at all, as they all have been located in varying locations and states of mind; some are more human-like than others, some have even been able to function as "human" in our society prior to being discovered. Despite these differences, each creature mimics <span>human-esc</span> qualities, from their body structures to their communication abilities. Several researchers have brought on their own theories for these evolutionary traits.</p>

            <h2>Louis Garnier</h2>
            <p><span>Doctor Garnier</span> was one of the most passionate researchers we had ever come across. His contributions to canny research are innumerable. His theories on the American canny population is still a major guideline for the project, and all future theories are derived in his thinking. Garnier sought out to emphasize the human qualities of cannies. Beyond surface physical observations, Garnier had mapped out <span>organ structures</span>, <span>mind maps</span>, and successfully ran experiments observing canny <span>social skills and <br>social needs</span>.</p>

            <h2>Bug Theory</h2>
            <p>In the same vein that hoverflies disguise themselves as bees, Doctor Garnier proposed the theory that cannies had evolved human-like traits to <span>protect themselves</span> from unknown predators. American canny ages were found to be remarkably old; canny ancestors may have existed all the way back to the <span>Paleolithic era</span>. Perhaps then these old predators have gone extinct. Their evolved traits would make them an invasive species in our society, but Garnier hoped that with rehabilitation they could be successfully and safely integrated amongst the American population.</p>

        <h2>Venus Theory</h2>
        <p>After Garnier had passed away, <span>Doctor Josef Koch</span> (current principal researcher) took charge with his own variation on <br><span>Bug Theory</span>. Gearing experimentation and studies away from commonalities shared between humans and cannies, Koch sought out to define in clear terms what separates us and what their roll in the food chain would be. While cannies in America could yield many benefits, Koch has pushed the program towards analyzing if they are safe to even release back into the wild after the program is completed.</p>

        <h2>Program Expansion</h2>
        <p>Doctor Koch has successfully pushed this program into a limitless study; gearing government attention further towards the importance of canny studies, he has nearly tripled government funding for more intense and in-depth experimentation. Staff size has also grown, allowing for more collaboration and specialized rolls. Koch has made moves towards expanding this program internationally, but it is unlikely other countries would cooperate with the study. <span><b>Please keep all information confidential, more than your job will be on the line.</b></span></p>

        <p>Doctor Koch has made a number of changes from Garnier's era, limiting canny enrichment measures for the sake of staff. <span><b>Cannies should not interact with each other, and staff should not speak with them, make eye-contact with them, or approach them without protective gear.</b></span> Group-experienced side-effects have been nearly eliminated, and multiple fail-safes have been implemented to ensure staff is not harmed in research. Orientation will go over <span>protective measures</span> and <span>good practices</span> to keep yourself and your team safe.</p>

            <p>Orientation should be starting soon. We're honored to have you on board for the project! While we want to protect our country and see how cannies may contribute to that, we also want to emphasize that you and your contributions to our program are deeply appreciated. While waiting to be taken inside, it is recommended to mentally prepare yourself and make sure your mental state is proper for canny engagement. Twisted human figures, distorted human faces, dita in gola and pain behind the eyes are all explored in canny research. If you do not think you can work in an environment regularly exposed to those kinds of imagery, please contact your off-site administrator and give him your precise coordinates to discuss further action. How do you feel? Are you experiencing any sudden changes? Does your environment feel different compared to when you first stepped inside? It is important to approach canny research with a fully clean head. Check your surroundings. Report the following side effects to your team leaders: nausea, sharp headaches, sudden joint pain, disorientation, vertigo, pain behind the eyes, dry mouth, distortions in perception, difficulty identifying faces, pain behind the eyes, I'm fucked, memory loss, short term memory loss, difficulty identifying your location, difficulty identifying country of origin, pain behind the eyes, sense of dread, pain behind the eyes, I'm fucked, pain behind the eyes, </p>
