        <p>Congratulations! Welcome to SAP™. Only the most elite of researchers have been called upon service to their country in <span>Canny Exploration</span>. Employee login information will be given upon completion of orientation. While waiting for further instruction, please review the Employee Handbook PDF, Post-Encounter Procedures (a full lecture will be provided), and familiarize yourself with SAP and her history. If orientation does not begin in the next forty five minutes, keep calm and dial the following number: <span><b>555-908-0040</b></span> and provide your coordinates to the answering official.</p>

        <h2>SAP's Conception</h2>
        <p>SAP (<span>Soft Angel Project</span>) was officially founded in 1941, but the discovery of cannies can be traced back to 1919. An unidentifiable creature was found miles away from a military base, with a nest spread across a 10 mile radius. While probing the suspected nest yielded no identification nor further signs of life, this first creature (affectionately called an <span>angel</span> by an on-sight private) revealed a world wide phenomena several countries were beginning to endure. Dubbed "cannies" for their human-like qualities, our program seeks to solve the <span>Great Canny Mystery</span>.</p>

        <h2>Cannies In America</h2>
        <p>SAP™ has now officially had 4 encounters with American-found cannies. It is not clear how these creatures connect to one another, if at all, as they all have been located in varying locations and states of mind; some are more human-like than others, some have even been able to function as "human" in our society prior to being discovered. Despite these differences, each creature mimics <span>human-esc</span> qualities, from their body structures to their communication abilities. Several researchers have brought on their own theories for these evolutionary traits.</p>
