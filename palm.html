<div class="intro">
    <p>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
I was born in 1968. April 12th, 1968.<br>
No, no. March 12th. My father was born in April.<br>
I am in Arizona.<br>
I am on the fifth floor of this building.<br>
The sign on the stairwell says floor 5.<br>
I walked up two flights of steps. There are three levels below my room.<br>
I am on the fifth floor.<br>
I am in room 12.<br>
The sign on the door says room 12.<br>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
I am a researcher.<br>
I wanted to be an entomologist.<br>
I wanted to be an artist. Entomologist just sounds better. And it’s not a total lie.<br>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
I need to take a shower today. Joe said I smell rotten.<br>
My hair is brown.<br>
My eyes are blue.<br>
No. Are they? There’s no mirrors in room 12.<br>
Ah. Yes, yes, I have my father’s eyes. My eyes are blue.<br>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
I am in the sixth chair from the door. It was the closest one I could get.<br>
5 12 6.<br>
That’s nonsense. But it feels like it should mean something. Is that an angel number?</p>
</div>
<span class="louis">Do you think 5126 is an important number, or something?</span><br>
<span class="joe">Do you?</span>
<p>
Ah. I probably shouldn’t bother Joe right now. He always knows when I’m feeling different.<br>
Right, right, my head is a little scrambled.<br>
My name is<br>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
My name<br>
My<br>
My name is<br>
My<br>
Louis Garnier<br>
Is<br>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
My name is<br>
</p>
<div class="eye">
    <p class="big">That is not me.<br>
        That is not me in room 12.<br>
        You are not me.<br>
        You will NEVER be me.<br>
        </p>
</div>
<p>
Sometimes Joe brings up conversations I know I didn’t have. I’m not a very religious person. He talks a lot about “angel numbers.” I think he just wants someone to listen, and I guess it’s easier for him to pretend like I’m the eccentric one dragging him into it.<br>
I’m, ah, not very good at saying no. So I just play along.<br>
<span class="joe">I just looked it up. It wasn’t too hard.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Oh, you didn’t have to do that. But thank you!</span><br>
<span class="joe">Google's free, doctor.</span><br>
I can never tell when he’s joking. His face stays stiff, and his tone is too even. I laughed this time. He smiled. I guessed right.<br>
I work in research. That’s too vague. I’m on the canny project. I’m in charge of the canny project. It doesn’t really feel like it, though. Ever since Joe’s come on board he’s been handling a lot of the tough decisions. I’m a bit nervous when it comes to serious matters. He takes charge when he’s impatient.<br>
I feel like he should be an outsider, but everyone loves him. I don’t really get it. He’s a bit rude, isn’t he? I wouldn’t mind being his friend, he just feels like the type of the guy no one would want to be around, for better or worse. You know, the kid everyone picked on in middle school who grows up to be a CEO, or something. Most people aren’t friendly with those types, they’re too frosty. And Joe is very, very cold.<br>
I never claimed to be smart, you know. I hate when he calls me doctor. We’re all doctors here. I get what he’s trying to say, it would be different if Keith or Brian said it. You know why? They say it like normal people. Joe has this way of just.<br>
Staring.<br>
He stares right into your eyes, the entire conversation. Am I the only one freaked out by that?<br>
I kind of sound like an asshole right now. Joe’s well meaning. He’s just, ah, inept. Socially. I should be flattered since everyone likes him so much. He never eats alone. He refuses to. If no one else is around he’ll sit and eat with me. It’s infuriating. He sits and talks about boats, or cats, or angel numbers. I hate when he talks about the numbers, they make my head spin.<br>
<span class="joe">Are you having lunch?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Like-I’m sorry. Do you mean right now?</span><br>
<span class="joe">You’ve been standing in the kitchen for half an hour.</span><br>
<span class="louis">What?</span><br>
I was going to my room. <br>
<span class="joe">I'm having dinner now.</span><br>
<span class="louis">You mean lunch?</span><br>
<span class="joe">I said dinner.</span><br>
You said lunch. He takes a chair from the table, dragging it over next to his own seat. <br>
<span class="joe">Sit.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I'm not really hungry right now.</span><br>
<span class="joe">You said that this morning. If you don’t eat you’ll get sick. Though you already look it.</span><br>
I sat down. He gave me half his plate. I don’t remember what the food was. It just made my gums sore.<br>
I don’t think he brushes his teeth. Maybe that’s why he looks so stern. Even when he smiles, he refuses to flash his teeth. His breath smells, and his teeth are at odd angles.<br>
My teeth aren’t white, but they’re straight. They’re an off-white. Eggshell. Coffee stains are just, you know. No one would believe that. They’re a bit yellow. I have a hard time remembering to brush. I do it at least once a day, though. At least I try.<br>
I count my teeth before bed. It just makes me feel more at ease, I think. I have bad dreams when I don’t. It calms my mind. <br>
26 proper teeth. My wisdom teeth are gone, and there’s two almost entirely made of fillings. They aren’t real teeth.<br>
I dream a lot about numbers. Or numbers appear in my dreams a lot, is probably a better way of putting it. They’re never the focus of the dream. <br>
1021. That was on a chalkboard. Joe was prattling on about something, I can’t remember what, but that number was right behind his head. I wonder if that means something?<br>
The way numbers pop up fascinates me. I’m surrounded by reoccurring numbers. 5126. 3478. And now 1021. And it’s usually when Joe is in the room! Fascinating. Maybe he’s an angel. I bet that would make him laugh.<br>
He didn’t take it well.<br>
His eyes just creased at the corners. What does that mean?<br>
What the fuck does that mean?<br>
At least I brush my teeth. I bet his are crooked. I bet they’re rotten.<br>
Ah. I forgot to shower. Goddamn it. Goddamn it. <br>
Goddamn it.<br>
He hates me. I bet he hates me.<br>
I don’t understand bringing up angel numbers if he’s going to make those faces. Neither of us ever enjoy it. Google it and keep it to yourself.<br>
I need to shower. My stomach hurts. I think I’m coming down with something.<br>
<br>
Bad day. Bad fucking day. <br>
I’ve been getting these, ah. What would you even call them?<br>
I’ve been sitting in the infirmary for a while now. Is it even an infirmary? I can’t check the sign from here. We keep simple medical equipment in this room. It’s quiet.<br>
No, I’ve been getting a strange feeling in my hand. My left hand, specifically. <br>
I’m in Arizona right now. The building’s called Spur Research, but we all just call it the Canny Labs. I’m at the Canny Labs in Arizona. Phoenix? No, it’s a few miles from a real small town. I can’t remember the name.<br>
There’s this pain deep in the center of my palm. Not pain. It’s uncomfortable is all. I just, ah. I just.<br>
I’m in the infirmary across Room 17. I looked at the sign as I went in. Room 17 is Joe’s office. They hadn’t gotten a plaque for him yet, so he’s only in Room 17. I looked at the number. <br>
I think I felt it moving? <br>
We were just trying to study this residue from XX53’s cell. It was somehow riding down the outer layer of the right wall. The hallway smelled rancid. I’m not even sure if its his, or if one of the other cannies is spreading. Spreading something. <br>
But we were just trying to see what the hell it was. It was solid, shaped like an egg but it sank in your hands. It was green, mossy. It reminded me more of a hairball, personally, but everyone started calling it an egg after Joe said that. <br>
You know, his hair is this ugly green? I can’t understand dying your hair that color. <br>
I wanted to wait to cut into it, but Joe took the lead and I didn’t know how to stop him. And then my hand started to feel less uncomfortable and more. More.<br>
It was moving.<br>
<span class="big">There’s something under my skin.There’s something under my skin.There’ssomethingundermyskin.Undermyskin.Undermyskin.</span><br>
You can’t feel it through those thick gloves. You probably couldn’t feel it even without them. It was in the center of my palm, swaying back and forth. I was clutching my scalpel.<br>
<span class="louis">I'm so sorry. I'll be right back.</span><br>
Joe didn’t look my way. I’m not sure they even heard me, but I had to get out of there. Maybe that’s why he was so angry.<br>
Anyway, I just wanted to sit in the bathroom and see what was going on. I poked my hand a little with the scalpel. Nothing too bad. Nothing to make a fuss about. I’m not stupid, I just was confused. And maybe a little scared.<br>
What do I even do? What would you do? You’re alone with a knife and there’s something moving in your hand, you’d cut it out wouldn’t you?<br>
Joe sends Kevin up to find me, and he starts yelling. I wasn’t bleeding. I had scratched my hand. I’m not stupid.<br>
I don’t want to see any of them. I don’t want to look at any of them. They don’t get it. Kevin exaggerates everything. They probably wouldn’t believe me even if I showed them my hand. The pain’s gone away anyway, so whatever I did must have worked. In the end, I guess it was worth it.<br>
I’m in room 17.<br>
No, I’m across it. I wish I checked the sign. It’s not called the infirmary, it’s a number.<br>
<span class="angel">Doctor Garnier?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Hello?</span><br>
<span class="angel">I’m really sorry to bother you, I just wanted to make sure you were alright.</span><br>
We haven’t had new people in a while. I think Oak joined the team a year ago? That’s pretty fresh. We hadn’t had anyone new before that in at least five, maybe six years. It’s a pretty steady project. I’m honestly not sure why he was brought on. I’m grateful though.<br>
His name is funny. I think his parents were hippies. But clearly the apple fell awfully far from the tree. Oak has a good head on his shoulders, though we haven’t had the pleasure of speaking alone much.<br>
<span class="angel">Oh my god.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It’s really not that bad. Just a scratch.</span><br>
<span class="angel">You need to be more careful!</span><br>
He has this very strange gesture he does. He shakes his wrists. A quick flick, back and forth. I can’t even mimic it right. I don’t get it, but he does it all time.<br>
Jesus, I don’t need any bandages. Put them back. But I can’t get any words out. He has slender hands. Strong fingers, they’re pressing against my left hand. I can his wedding band catching on my skin.<br>
He’s married? No, he can’t be. This is the kind of job that usually leads to breakups. Maybe he just liked the ring. But on his left hand? On his 4th finger?<br>
<span class="angel">It's pretty, huh?</span><br>
<span class="louis">I didn't mean to stare.</span><br>
<span class="angel">But it's a beautiful ring. I'd hope you'd stare.</span><br>
I wanted him to tell me more, but he was done with the gauze. Instead it was back in the cabinets and he closed the door behind him. I asked what room this was, but I think he was already gone.
<br><br>
Oak wears a size M coat. And I remember the first time we met, there was only an XL lying around to give. He looked like a little kid. I think it was the only time I heard Joe laugh.<br>
I think Joe really likes Oak. He’s by his side whenever he can. And when he can’t, he’s usually by mine. I don’t get why, I’ve never really thought we clicked.<br>
<span class="joe">You know that number you were asking about?</span><br>
I just want to eat breakfast.<br>
<span class="louis">I think!</span><br>
<span class="joe">It's Oak's ID number.</span><br>
What?<br>
<span class="joe">I mean, obviously it also has meaning, but if you look at his ID the first four numbers line up. I just thought it was a funny coincidence.</span><br>
His face is still steady. I force a laugh. I don't know what number he's talking about.<br>
My favorite part of this project is the hands on studies. I like physically being with the cannies, even if it’s through all the protective gear. It’s the one line Joe hates to cross, and I think it’s the one thing people turn to me for. I love studying XXNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULL<br>
XX[REDACTED]. They’re each charming in their own way, but he just has this playful aura to him. I think he’s the closest to understanding what I’m saying. He repeats a lot of what I say, and his pronunciations are spot on. He knows my name, and he calls it out whenever I enter his cell. Sometimes he’ll try to string a sentence together. I don’t know if he’ll ever be able to process grammar though. The closest I’ve gotten is name recognition. He knows colors, and he preforms so well on flashcard tests. I don’t know how to help him to the next level, but I want to believe we’ll get there.<br>
I’m being selfish today, though. No one questions me when I enter their rooms, so sometimes I like to visit them to unwind. It’s been a rough week.<br>
<span class="louis">I had a funny dream last night.</span><br>
He nods along.<br>
<span class="louis">Do you believe in angel numbers? I keep having dreams with 1021 appearing. This time, I had to paint a portrait of the president. But when I went to give it to him, I was sat at his desk! And I look at the painting, and it’s the 1021st president of the United States: myself. Crazy.</span><br>
I think he’s safe to touch, wrapped up like this. I rest a rubber-clad head against his shoulder.<br>
<span class="louis">You think America will even be around that long? I mean, that’s another 4,000ish years, right? If we have a president every four years? No, wait, sometimes they’re around for eight. Or is it two years, sometimes four...? I should know this.</span><br>
He laughs whenever I laugh, but I doubt he found it funny.<br>
<span class="louis">At this rate, the Earth will be a faint memory by then. Which means I’ll never even have a chance to run for president.</span><br>
I like nonsense conversations. Sometimes I’ll just start listing words or numbers that come to mind. XX[REDACTED] always nods along. He likes to pretend he understands what I’m saying, like a dog waiting for a word he knows. I appreciate it, actually. I’ve always wanted a dog, or maybe a cat. Eugh. I feel gross. I need to shower.<br>
My head has been in knots. I haven’t taken the bandage off yet. I wanted to show him, and I don’t think I told him about Oak yet. But I’m not going to get the chance any time soon.<br>
Joe brushed past me on the stairwell. I think he’s working down there today. I go down three flights, trying to find whichever hallway had the lights on. Mm. He’s all the way on the bottom floor.<br>
They moved all the cannies but one a floor up. XX53 can be troublesome. I actually haven’t seen him in a long time. I’ve never had the pleasure to speak with him one to one either. Maybe someday.<br>
Is it weird to call them “he?” “She?” Joe throws around “it” a lot. Everyone followed suit. We do it for animals, though. I know they’re not quite human, certainly not animal, but they’re bordering awfully close, right? Maybe I’m just being stupid. I don’t even know what they’d prefer. Maybe they like “it.” I wish I could ask them.<br>
What’s Joe even doing down here? He has such loud footsteps. You know he’s rushing when he’s stomping around. Oh! I didn’t even notice he was in his protective gear.<br>
<span class="joe">Hey.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Hi! Is everything alright?</span><br>
I guess he was too far down the hallway to hear me. Eh.<br>
<span class="angel">Oh! Doctor Garnier, hello.</span><br>
Oak was inside XX53’s cell, waving behind a glass wall. I hadn’t even noticed him there.<br>
<span class="louis">Is, ah, that safe?</span><br>
<span class="angel">He’s not inside, don’t worry! Doctor Koch moved him. We’re trying to figure out what’s going on with his camera.</span><br>
His footage always comes out distorted. It’s been making it difficult to make sure he’s alright. There’s some self-destructive tendencies we’ve been trying to monitor. He scratches his arms a lot, I noticed. Whenever we move him or have to come inside his enclosure, he has something hurt; bruises, cuts, and I’ve noticed a lot of injuries around the throat. I doubt we could stop him even with better surveillance, though. I keep telling Joe we should just restrain him, but he always shoots it down.<br>
<span class="angel">I was worried it was a signal issue being this far underground, but it’s working fine now that he’s out of the room. Doctor Koch is checking to see if the camera’s working now that he’s a few rooms over. I’m guessing not though, he looked pretty frustrated when he came back down.</span><br>
<span class="louis">What do you think we should do, then?</span><br>
<span class="angel">I'm not sure. It seems like he isn’t intentionally messing with it though. I mean, he’s unconscious right now, and it still isn’t working. Have you ever tried a different type of camera? I feel like there just needs to be something where a signal can’t be choked out by whatever’s going on with him.</span><br>
<span class="louis">We can probably get something new in, though it might take a while to get here.</span><br>
He scanned the door back open, but his fingers were covering the ID number when he emerged. It was back in his pocket too soon.<br>
<span class="angel">We should get lanyards or something. I keep freaking out thinking I’m gonna lose this.</span><br>
<span class="louis">That would be nice.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Any luck?</span><br>
<span class="angel">No, you were right. The camera footage completely cleared up after you took him out.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Shit. It’s the problem then. Until we figure something out there’s no way to monitor it.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Do you think we could try a camera outside the cell? I mean, We can look inside from here, the glass isn’t the clearest but it’s probably better than the quality we’re getting up there.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Maybe. I’m just worried it’ll still be too close. Do you have your phone with you? I want to see if we can get pictures outside his cell.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I could take the pictures, if you need help.</span><br>
The corners of his eyes crinkled again.<br>
<span class="joe">Just call the representative. Whatever her name is.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Diane? I think?</span><br>
<span class="joe">I don’t keep up with them. Tell her we’re still working on XX53’s situation and we might need new cameras. We have to get them in as soon as possible, and I don’t want them pussyfooting us again like last time.</span><br>
<span class="louis">To be fair, it wasn’t an emergency. It was just some faulty lighting.</span><br>
Joe was already headed around the bend. Oak disappeared around the corner with him.<br>
I was in my room the whole time.<br>
Joe just. He just SAYS things. Things that never happened. And he’s getting Oak in on it too. I feel cornered. Though I do like seeing his face more, even if it’s with furrowed brows.<br>
I wasn’t feeling well, so I stayed in bed today. I even told Kevin. He backed me up, surprisingly. I’ve been trying to leave more of a testimony trail. Joe looked frustrated and said something about making a call. I don’t understand what his problem is.<br>
<span class="angel">Are you feeling alright?</span><br>


</p>


<span class="louis">Hi, I'm Louis!</span><br>
<span class="joe">I'm Joe.</span><br>
<span class="angel">I'm Oak!</span><br>
<span class="redacted">Hey! Hey!</span><br>
<span class="lord">A burning wheel.</span><br>
<span class="soft">It'll come out soon.</span>
