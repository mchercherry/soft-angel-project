<div class="intro">
    <p>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
I was born in 1968. April 12th, 1968.<br>
No, no. March 12th. My father was born in April.<br>
I am in Arizona.<br>
I am on the fifth floor of this building.<br>
The sign on the stairwell says floor 5.<br>
I walked up two flights of steps. There are three levels below my room.<br>
I am on the fifth floor.<br>
I am in room 12.<br>
The sign on the door says room 12.<br>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
I am a researcher.<br>
I wanted to be an entomologist.<br>
I wanted to be an artist. Entomologist just sounds better. And it’s not a total lie.<br>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
I need to take a shower today. Joe said I smell rotten.<br>
My hair is brown.<br>
My eyes are blue.<br>
No. Are they? There’s no mirrors in room 12.<br>
Ah. Yes, yes, I have my father’s eyes. My eyes are blue.<br>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
I am in the sixth chair from the door. It was the closest one I could get.<br>
5 12 6.<br>
That’s nonsense. But it feels like it should mean something. Is that an angel number?</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class="louis">Do you think 5126 is an important number, or something?</span><br>
<span class="joe">Do you?</span><br>
Ah. I probably shouldn’t bother Joe right now. He always knows when I’m feeling different.<br>
Right, right, my head is a little scrambled.<br>
My name is<br>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
My name<br>
My<br>
My name is<br>
My<br>
Louis Garnier<br>
Is<br>
My name is Louis Garnier.<br>
My name is<br>
</p>
<div class="eye">
    <p class="big">That is not me.<br>
        That is not me in room 12.<br>
        You are not me.<br>
        You will NEVER be me.<br>
        </p>
</div>
<p>
Sometimes Joe brings up conversations I know I didn’t have. I’m not a very religious person. He talks a lot about “angel numbers.” I think he just wants someone to listen, and I guess it’s easier for him to pretend like I’m the eccentric one dragging him into it.<br>
I’m, ah, not very good at saying no. So I just play along.<br>
<span class="joe">I just looked it up. It wasn’t too hard.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Oh, you didn’t have to do that. But thank you!</span><br>
<span class="joe">Google's free, doctor.</span><br>
I can never tell when he’s joking. His face stays stiff, and his tone is too even. I laughed this time. He smiled. I guessed right.<br>
I work in research. That’s too vague. I’m on the canny project. I’m in charge of the canny project. It doesn’t really feel like it, though. Ever since Joe’s come on board he’s been handling a lot of the tough decisions. I’m a bit nervous when it comes to serious matters. He takes charge when he’s impatient.<br>
I feel like he should be an outsider, but everyone loves him. I don’t really get it. He’s a bit rude, isn’t he? I wouldn’t mind being his friend, he just feels like the type of the guy no one would want to be around, for better or worse. You know, the kid everyone picked on in middle school who grows up to be a CEO, or something. Most people aren’t friendly with those types, they’re too frosty. And Joe is very, very cold.<br>
I never claimed to be smart, you know. I hate when he calls me doctor. We’re all doctors here. I get what he’s trying to say, it would be different if Keith or Brian said it. You know why? They say it like normal people. Joe has this way of just.<br>
Staring.<br>
He stares right into your eyes, the entire conversation. Am I the only one freaked out by that?<br>
I kind of sound like an asshole right now. Joe’s well meaning. He’s just, ah, inept. Socially. I should be flattered since everyone likes him so much. He never eats alone. He refuses to. If no one else is around he’ll sit and eat with me. It’s infuriating. He sits and talks about boats, or cats, or angel numbers. I hate when he talks about the numbers, they make my head spin.<br>
<span class="joe">Are you having lunch?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Like-I’m sorry. Do you mean right now?</span><br>
<span class="joe">You’ve been standing in the kitchen for half an hour.</span><br>
<span class="louis">What?</span><br>
I was going to my room. <br>
<span class="joe">I'm having dinner now.</span><br>
<span class="louis">You mean lunch?</span><br>
<span class="joe">I said dinner.</span><br>
You said lunch. He takes a chair from the table, dragging it over next to his own seat. <br>
<span class="joe">Sit.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I'm not really hungry right now.</span><br>
<span class="joe">You said that this morning. If you don’t eat you’ll get sick. Though you already look it.</span><br>
I sat down. He gave me half his plate. I don’t remember what the food was. It just made my gums sore.<br>
I don’t think he brushes his teeth. Maybe that’s why he looks so stern. Even when he smiles, he refuses to flash his teeth. His breath smells, and his teeth are at odd angles.<br>
My teeth aren’t white, but they’re straight. They’re an off-white. Eggshell. Coffee stains are just, you know. No one would believe that. They’re a bit yellow. I have a hard time remembering to brush. I do it at least once a day, though. At least I try.<br>
I count my teeth before bed. It just makes me feel more at ease, I think. I have bad dreams when I don’t. It calms my mind. <br>
26 proper teeth. My wisdom teeth are gone, and there’s two almost entirely made of fillings. They aren’t real teeth.<br>
I dream a lot about numbers. Or numbers appear in my dreams a lot, is probably a better way of putting it. They’re never the focus of the dream. <br>
1021. That was on a chalkboard. Joe was prattling on about something, I can’t remember what, but that number was right behind his head. I wonder if that means something?<br>
The way numbers pop up fascinates me. I’m surrounded by reoccurring numbers. 5126. 3478. And now 1021. And it’s usually when Joe is in the room! Fascinating. Maybe he’s an angel. I bet that would make him laugh.<br>
He didn’t take it well.<br>
His eyes just creased at the corners. What does that mean?<br>
What the fuck does that mean?<br>
At least I brush my teeth. I bet his are crooked. I bet they’re rotten.<br>
Ah. I forgot to shower. Goddamn it. Goddamn it. <br>
Goddamn it.<br>
He hates me. I bet he hates me.<br>
I don’t understand bringing up angel numbers if he’s going to make those faces. Neither of us ever enjoy it. Google it and keep it to yourself.<br>
I need to shower. My stomach hurts. I think I’m coming down with something.<br>
<br>
Bad day. Bad fucking day. <br>
I’ve been getting these, ah. What would you even call them?<br>
I’ve been sitting in the infirmary for a while now. Is it even an infirmary? I can’t check the sign from here. We keep simple medical equipment in this room. It’s quiet.<br>
No, I’ve been getting a strange feeling in my hand. My left hand, specifically. <br>
I’m in Arizona right now. The building’s called Spur Research, but we all just call it the Canny Labs. I’m at the Canny Labs in Arizona. Phoenix? No, it’s a few miles from a real small town. I can’t remember the name.<br>
There’s this pain deep in the center of my palm. Not pain. It’s uncomfortable is all. I just, ah. I just.<br>
I’m in the infirmary across Room 17. I looked at the sign as I went in. Room 17 is Joe’s office. They hadn’t gotten a plaque for him yet, so he’s only in Room 17. I looked at the number. <br>
I think I felt it moving? <br>
We were just trying to study this residue from XX53’s cell. It was somehow riding down the outer layer of the right wall. The hallway smelled rancid. I’m not even sure if its his, or if one of the other cannies is spreading. Spreading something. <br>
But we were just trying to see what the hell it was. It was solid, shaped like an egg but it sank in your hands. It was green, mossy. It reminded me more of a hairball, personally, but everyone started calling it an egg after Joe said that. <br>
You know, his hair is this ugly green? I can’t understand dying your hair that color. <br>
I wanted to wait to cut into it, but Joe took the lead and I didn’t know how to stop him. And then my hand started to feel less uncomfortable and more. More.<br>
It was moving.<br>
<span class="big">There’s something under my skin.There’s something under my skin.There’ssomethingundermyskin.Undermyskin.Undermyskin.</span><br>
You can’t feel it through those thick gloves. You probably couldn’t feel it even without them. It was in the center of my palm, swaying back and forth. I was clutching my scalpel.<br>
<span class="louis">I'm so sorry. I'll be right back.</span><br>
Joe didn’t look my way. I’m not sure they even heard me, but I had to get out of there. Maybe that’s why he was so angry.<br>
Anyway, I just wanted to sit in the bathroom and see what was going on. I poked my hand a little with the scalpel. Nothing too bad. Nothing to make a fuss about. I’m not stupid, I just was confused. And maybe a little scared.<br>
What do I even do? What would you do? You’re alone with a knife and there’s something moving in your hand, you’d cut it out wouldn’t you?<br>
Joe sends Kevin up to find me, and he starts yelling. I wasn’t bleeding. I had scratched my hand. I’m not stupid.<br>
I don’t want to see any of them. I don’t want to look at any of them. They don’t get it. Kevin exaggerates everything. They probably wouldn’t believe me even if I showed them my hand. The pain’s gone away anyway, so whatever I did must have worked. In the end, I guess it was worth it.<br>
I’m in room 17.<br>
No, I’m across it. I wish I checked the sign. It’s not called the infirmary, it’s a number.<br>
<span class="angel">Doctor Garnier?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Hello?</span><br>
<span class="angel">I’m really sorry to bother you, I just wanted to make sure you were alright.</span><br>
We haven’t had new people in a while. I think Oak joined the team a year ago? That’s pretty fresh. We hadn’t had anyone new before that in at least five, maybe six years. It’s a pretty steady project. I’m honestly not sure why he was brought on. I’m grateful though.<br>
His name is funny. I think his parents were hippies. But clearly the apple fell awfully far from the tree. Oak has a good head on his shoulders, though we haven’t had the pleasure of speaking alone much.<br>
<span class="angel">Oh my god.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It’s really not that bad. Just a scratch.</span><br>
<span class="angel">You need to be more careful!</span><br>
He has this very strange gesture he does. He shakes his wrists. A quick flick, back and forth. I can’t even mimic it right. I don’t get it, but he does it all time.<br>
Jesus, I don’t need any bandages. Put them back. But I can’t get any words out. He has slender hands. Strong fingers, they’re pressing against my left hand. I can feel his wedding band catching on my skin.<br>
He’s married? No, he can’t be. This is the kind of job that usually leads to breakups. Maybe he just liked the ring. But on his left hand? On his 4th finger?<br>
<span class="angel">It's pretty, huh?</span><br>
<span class="louis">I didn't mean to stare.</span><br>
<span class="angel">But it's a beautiful ring. I'd hope you'd stare.</span><br>
I wanted him to tell me more, but he was done with the gauze. Instead it was back in the cabinets and he closed the door behind him. I asked what room this was, but I think he was already gone.
<br><br>
Oak wears a size M coat. And I remember the first time we met, there was only an XL lying around to give. He looked like a little kid. I think it was the only time I heard Joe laugh.<br>
I think Joe really likes Oak. He’s by his side whenever he can. And when he can’t, he’s usually by mine. I don’t get why, I’ve never really thought we clicked.<br>
<span class="joe">You know that number you were asking about?</span><br>
I just want to eat breakfast.<br>
<span class="louis">I think!</span><br>
<span class="joe">It's Oak's ID number.</span><br>
What?<br>
<span class="joe">I mean, obviously it also has meaning, but if you look at his ID the first four numbers line up. I just thought it was a funny coincidence.</span><br>
His face is still steady. I force a laugh. I don't know what number he's talking about.<br>
My favorite part of this project is the hands on studies. I like physically being with the cannies, even if it’s through all the protective gear. It’s the one line Joe hates to cross, and I think it’s the one thing people turn to me for. I love studying XXNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULLNULL<br>
XX[REDACTED]. They’re each charming in their own way, but he just has this playful aura to him. I think he’s the closest to understanding what I’m saying. He repeats a lot of what I say, and his pronunciations are spot on. He knows my name, and he calls it out whenever I enter his cell. Sometimes he’ll try to string a sentence together. I don’t know if he’ll ever be able to process grammar though. The closest I’ve gotten is name recognition. He knows colors, and he preforms so well on flashcard tests. I don’t know how to help him to the next level, but I want to believe we’ll get there.<br>
I’m being selfish today, though. No one questions me when I enter their rooms, so sometimes I like to visit them to unwind. It’s been a rough week.<br>
<span class="redacted">Hey! Hey! Lou!</span><br>
He calls me Lou now, he must've picked that up from Joe. Incredible, really.<br>
<span class="louis">I had a funny dream last night.</span><br>
He nods along.<br>
<span class="louis">Do you believe in angel numbers? I keep having dreams with 1021 appearing. This time, I had to paint a portrait of the president. But when I went to give it to him, I was sat at his desk! And I look at the painting, and it’s the 1021st president of the United States: myself. Crazy.</span><br>
I think he’s safe to touch, wrapped up like this. I rest a rubber-clad head against his shoulder.<br>
<span class="louis">You think America will even be around that long? I mean, that’s another 4,000ish years, right? If we have a president every four years? No, wait, sometimes they’re around for eight. Or is it two years, sometimes four...? I should know this.</span><br>
He laughs whenever I laugh, but I doubt he found it funny.<br>
<span class="louis">At this rate, the Earth will be a faint memory by then. Which means I’ll never even have a chance to run for president.</span><br>
I like nonsense conversations. Sometimes I’ll just start listing words or numbers that come to mind. XX[REDACTED] always nods along. He likes to pretend he understands what I’m saying, like a dog waiting for a word he knows. I appreciate it, actually. I’ve always wanted a dog, or maybe a cat. Eugh. I feel gross. I need to shower.<br>
My head has been in knots. I haven’t taken the bandage off yet. I wanted to show him, and I don’t think I told him about Oak yet. But I’m not going to get the chance any time soon.<br>
Joe brushed past me on the stairwell. I think he’s working down there today. I go down three flights, trying to find whichever hallway had the lights on. Mm. He’s all the way on the bottom floor.<br>
They moved all the cannies but one a floor up. XX53 can be troublesome. I actually haven’t seen him in a long time. I’ve never had the pleasure to speak with him one to one either. Maybe someday.<br>
Is it weird to call them “he?” “She?” Joe throws around “it” a lot. Everyone followed suit. We do it for animals, though. I know they’re not quite human, certainly not animal, but they’re bordering awfully close, right? Maybe I’m just being stupid. I don’t even know what they’d prefer. Maybe they like “it.” I wish I could ask them.<br>
What’s Joe even doing down here? He has such loud footsteps. You know he’s rushing when he’s stomping around. Oh! I didn’t even notice he was in his protective gear.<br>
<span class="joe">Hey.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Hi! Is everything alright?</span><br>
I guess he was too far down the hallway to hear me. Eh.<br>
<span class="angel">Oh! Doctor Garnier, hello.</span><br>
Oak was inside XX53’s cell, waving behind a glass wall. I hadn’t even noticed him there.<br>
<span class="louis">Is, ah, that safe?</span><br>
<span class="angel">He’s not inside, don’t worry! Doctor Koch moved him. We’re trying to figure out what’s going on with his camera.</span><br>
His footage always comes out distorted. It’s been making it difficult to make sure he’s alright. There’s some self-destructive tendencies we’ve been trying to monitor. He scratches his arms a lot, I noticed. Whenever we move him or have to come inside his enclosure, he has something hurt; bruises, cuts, and I’ve noticed a lot of injuries around the throat. I doubt we could stop him even with better surveillance, though. I keep telling Joe we should just restrain him, but he always shoots it down.<br>
<span class="angel">I was worried it was a signal issue being this far underground, but it’s working fine now that he’s out of the room. Doctor Koch is checking to see if the camera’s working now that he’s a few rooms over. I’m guessing not though, he looked pretty frustrated when he came back down.</span><br>
<span class="louis">What do you think we should do, then?</span><br>
<span class="angel">I'm not sure. It seems like he isn’t intentionally messing with it though. I mean, he’s unconscious right now, and it still isn’t working. Have you ever tried a different type of camera? I feel like there just needs to be something where a signal can’t be choked out by whatever’s going on with him.</span><br>
<span class="louis">We can probably get something new in, though it might take a while to get here.</span><br>
He scanned the door back open, but his fingers were covering the ID number when he emerged. It was back in his pocket too soon.<br>
<span class="angel">We should get lanyards or something. I keep freaking out thinking I’m gonna lose this.</span><br>
<span class="louis">That would be nice.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Any luck?</span><br>
<span class="angel">No, you were right. The camera footage completely cleared up after you took him out.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Shit. It’s the problem then. Until we figure something out there’s no way to monitor it.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Do you think we could try a camera outside the cell? I mean, We can look inside from here, the glass isn’t the clearest but it’s probably better than the quality we’re getting up there.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Maybe. I’m just worried it’ll still be too close. Do you have your phone with you? I want to see if we can get pictures outside his cell.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I could take the pictures, if you need help.</span><br>
The corners of his eyes crinkled again.<br>
<span class="joe">Just call the representative. Whatever her name is.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Diane? I think?</span><br>
<span class="joe">I don’t keep up with them. Tell her we’re still working on XX53’s situation and we might need new cameras. We have to get them in as soon as possible, and I don’t want them pussyfooting us again like last time.</span><br>
<span class="louis">To be fair, it wasn’t an emergency. It was just some faulty lighting.</span><br>
Joe was already headed around the bend. Oak disappeared around the corner with him.<br>
I was in my room the whole time.<br>
Joe just. He just SAYS things. Things that never happened. And he’s getting Oak in on it too. I feel cornered. Though I do like seeing his face more, even if it’s with furrowed brows.<br>
I wasn’t feeling well, so I stayed in bed today. I even told Kevin. He backed me up, surprisingly. I’ve been trying to leave more of a testimony trail. Joe looked frustrated and said something about making a call. I don’t understand what his problem is.<br>
<span class="angel">Are you feeling alright?</span><br>
<span class="louis">I am. I mean, I’ve been dealing with a bit of a stomach bug, I think. And a bit of the chills. But it’s nothing serious. It’s that time of the year after all.</span><br>
<span class="angel">That’s true. Is your hand doing better?</span><br>
<span class="louis">It was fine to begin with. Don’t worry.</span><br>
He has a handsome smile. His teeth are white. Very white.<br>
My hand is bothering me again. I’m not sure what to do. Do I have to report this? I can’t afford any major trouble. It doesn’t even hurt that bad. It’s just this odd pain. My hand feels a bit numb today, but no discoloration. I tried making a log of my symptoms, but it just turned out nonsense.<br>
It’s moving.<br>
There’s this. It feels like wiggling.<br>
It’s ok. Calm down. People are sleeping. I’m in my room. I’m on the bottom floor. That’s floor one, ground zero. Room 21.<br>
But it’s moving. That’s not normal. Pain doesn’t move. THINGS move. Something is in my hand.<br>
You’re fucking insane. Things aren’t in hands, not things that aren’t meant to be there. Not in a place like this. I’m fine. I just need to breath. It’ll pass.<br>
<br>
It didn’t pass.<br>
Joe caught me in the bathroom with my scalpel again. He was fuming. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to tell him. He just took it from me and went back to bed.<br>
I need to get one of those. I need one for my room. My hand hurt the rest of the night, couldn’t sleep a wink. But it’s better now. I patched myself up before anyone could complain, since they all worry so much.<br>
I don’t think Joe told Oak, though. He was very pleasant this morning. We ate breakfast together.<br>
I’m fascinated by him. You know he likes to draw? I mean he hasn’t had much time to keep up with it, but he brought a sketchbook. He likes to draw little animals. Birds, lots of crows, there was a fox hiding somewhere in there. He’s so... confident. It was actually his idea to show me. I guess I do seem the type to like art. But he just sat me down and shared his drawings like it was nothing. His voice was even, his eyes were steady, and when we hit the end he just put it away. It was so natural for him.<br>
<span class="louis">I, ah, actually used to draw quite a bit myself. When I was younger, I mean. Now you’ve got me all nostalgic.</span><br>
<span class="angel">It’s never too late to pick it back up, you know. I’d love to see your work.</span><br>
He has such nice hands. I was able to brush my pinky against his thumb before he was tucking the book away.<br>
<span class="joe">Oak?</span><br>
Joe was staring right at me. How long was he in the doorway?<br>
<span class="joe">I think we should stick with your idea. Diane said she’ll get the shipment in as soon as she can, but I don’t know how long that’ll take.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Things work slower than I thought they would.</span><br>
God, his laugh is so ugly. No wonder he hides his teeth. Ugly teeth. Brush your teeth.<br>
<br>
I feel like I’ve been getting angrier. Joe’s just getting worse with these numbers. There’s only so many times I can get a snarky explanation of a number I didn’t ask about before I want to snap. His breath smells bad. He keeps telling me I need to shower. Do I smell bad? People would’ve said something if it was that bad, right?<br>
I can deal with that. I can’t fucking take the babysitting. I am a grown man. We are adults. I can’t go to the bathroom anymore without him standing by the door.<br>
<span class="louis">Do you need something?</span><br>
<span class="joe">Not particularly. Just checking on you.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I’m just trying to do my business. Not a big deal.</span><br>
<span class="joe">There’s a scalpel missing from Lab 7B.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Ok. You don’t have to report that to me, stuff goes missing all the time.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Look, you’ve just been-. Is something going on?</span><br>
<span class="louis">I haven’t been getting much space lately.</span><br>
<span class="joe">You don’t seem yourself. And a few people have been getting worried.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Tell them to relax then. I’m fine.</span><br>
<span class="joe">You’re stressing yourself out, and there’s better ways to deal with it.</span><br>
I don't need this.<br>
<span class="louis">Joe, I can’t eat without you bothering me about nonsense numbers. Talk to Oak about it, or bother Kevin, if anyone’s stressing me out it’s you! All of you, fretting about my hand, about cameras, I don’t know what any of you are talking about.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Then stop asking me about them.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Joe. <i>JOE.</i> Look at me. Look into my eyes. Read my lips. I don’t care about angel numbers. Angel numbers are bullshit. Ok? If “I” ever ask you about them, ignore me. Because you aren’t speaking to me, I would never ask you about them. Ok?</span><br>
His frown deepened. I could feel myself tensing up. He’s a lot bigger than me. I don’t know how he stays so fit. It’s not like I think he’d ever take a swing at me, he’s just not the kind of guy you’d want upset with you. But he nodded, and gave a polite “ok” before finally leaving his perch at the door. I thought he’d never leave. My hand is killing me.<br>
<br>
I’ve been waiting for a day where Joe was on the phone. A proper call, he’s too quick with Diane. He can talk to his daughter for hours, and he always locks himself in his office so no one overhears. Room 17 has been closed for an hour now.<br>
It’s a lucky day for sure. Upstairs in Lab 2A most people are still poking around with XX53’s... item. Still no identification, nothing he’s ever secreted before. The basements lights were on, but only on GA. GC’s completely vacant, and I doubt anyone would notice me heading down. I brought a flashlight to keep the hallway dark, but I doubt anyone would question me anyway. I just feel like I’m on thin ice with everyone, for some reason. I don’t need them worrying any more.<br>
I think it’s just all the camera talk mixed with the moss testing, but I’ve been having this weird ache to see you-know-who. It’s been a while, at least for anything I usually like. There just was never a good excuse to sit down with him, and Joe gets funny whenever I’d bring him up. He’s a frustrating thing, I don’t blame him. He was fairly aggressive when he came into my care, but there hasn’t been any incidents in years. I’d argue my dear XX[REDACTED] is more active than he is right now. These are very social creatures, no matter what Joe says. I know what I’m talking about. I’m the one in charge.<br> 
I miss letting them talk. We had a common cell they could sit in and chat. I mean there’s only four of them, but they all seemed to hit it off. But, ah, there was an issue. Well, no. No it wasn’t an issue. I don’t even know what I’m talking about.<br>
XX53 never really clicked with the others. I mean, people have said otherwise, but I always saw him hovering around XX19. He was a very touchy person. Person? Canny. Very hands on, even though her anatomy is the least human out of any of them. He liked to grasp onto her, any of her. I thought it was sweet, but it always bothered Joe.<br>
I forgot how dark it gets down here. Maybe I should have turned on the lights? No, I can’t afford any trouble. I know my way down here. Shit. Shit my hand’s acting up again. It’s not too bad. I’ll push through it. Today’s my lucky day.<br>
It was sweet in a twisted sort of way. That’s stupid to say, it was grotesque. But I don’t think it’s something punishable.<br>
<span class="big">He gave her his eyes.</span><br>
XX19 could not see as far as we were aware. But now she can recognize colors. She makes eye contact. Whatever he did, no matter how painful, it worked. It’s admirable, I think. Though I probably shouldn’t admit that.<br>
He’s blind now, naturally. I wish I was there to clean him up, but Joe took care of that with Kevin and his partners. I’m not sure why they didn’t have me help. <br>
Room 53. It actually used to be Room 20, but we just call them after their numbers now. I guess any of these cells could be the 53rd if he was inside. It’s hard to see through the glass, it’s a little hazy on his side, but it looks like he’s curled up in the corner of the room. He doesn’t turn when the door opens. That’s fine.<br>
<span class="lord">...Burning wheel...</span><br>
He was muttering something into the wall, but as soon as I got close he jolted up. His face is still bandaged. I’m not sure when they’re supposed to come off.<br>
<span class="louis">Hello.</span><br>
He’s probably the worst with word recognition. He strings short bursts of random words, and his pronunciations are. They’re. Well, they’re noticeable. He moves his tongue strangely. I’ve been hoping to get another oral study in.<br>
Sometimes he can be aggressive. But usually, at least nowadays, he just lies on the floor, belly down during in-person check ins. I wish I could tell him today was different. He spent the rest of our time curled up in the corner, head turned from me. We sat together in silence for a long while, only interrupted by one word sentences and grunts.<br>
<span class="lord">Eyes.</span><br>
<span class="louis">You probably miss yours.</span><br>
<span class="lord">Mm.</span><br>
<span class="louis">At least it was romantic. I thought so anyway.</span><br>
An odd clicking noise came from the corner. I think he was trying to laugh.<br>
I think I’m having a harder time following, ah, time? I thought I was only with XX53 for maybe an hour or two at most. But when I came back upstairs Oak was headed to the kitchen and asked me to join him and Joe for dinner. It’s 9 at night right now. That was three hours ago. I went downstairs at. At, ah. Fuck. What time? I didn’t think to look at a clock. I should have. Maybe I went down later than I thought.<br>
<span class="joe">Hey, Lou?</span><br>
Joe needs to stop hanging outside this goddamn bathroom.<br>
<span class="louis">Yeah?</span><br>
<span class="joe">I just wanted to say thanks for today. I really needed that. Sorry I didn’t say anything earlier, it’s just not the kind of thing I want the others overhearing, you know?</span><br>
What is he always on about?<br>
<span class="louis">Oh, uh. Yeah.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Yeah. Goodnight. And thanks again.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Sure, sure. Goodnight.</span><br>
It feels like he’s just making up stories at this point. At least he’s being nicer.<br><br>
I had a bad dream. I had a horrible dream.<br>
I haven’t had a nightmare about it in a long time. I thought things were getting better. I thought things were getting better. I thought things were getting better.<br>
My stomach hurts.<br>
I hate the church dreams. I hate being up at the altar. I was a reader when I was younger, and then an altar boy. And I hate that church. I hate the windows, the wood, the pews, I hate it. I hate the priest. I hate him. I hate him.<br>
My hand is really acting up today. Between that and my stomach, and it’s getting harder to keep everyone off my back. Goddamn it. Goddamn it, I’ve got this annoying headache too. Right behind the eyes, I don’t remember what that means. It’s probably a stress pain. I wouldn’t be surprised.<br>
I feel gross today. My insides are in knots. I. I need a shower. I need a hot shower, and I need to calm down.<br>
God. I forgot how good it feels. The idea of a shower is so exhausting, but I never want to leave when I get in. I sit, and I let the water warm me up, and I can just exist. My head still races, it’s racing right now. I’m saying nonsense. But I feel safe. I think. My hand still hurts.<br>
This is one of those “plastic” showers, where all the corners are rounded off in a big thick shell. It’s practically made to rest your head and soak in the water.<br>
More than just my hand was aching. I didn’t realize how tensed up I was. It’s almost unnatural to feel myself unwind. I’ve fallen asleep in the shower before. It’s always embarrassing. But it’s hard to stop myself from nodding off. This is the one place where no one can see me. No one. No cameras, no eyes, I’m barely perceived. Have you ever felt eyes on you? I have. I have many times. Many times. Many eyes.<br>
<span class="angel">Oh god.</span><br>
<span class="joe">You have to be more careful.</span><br>
<span class="angel">I asked for help, not a lecture!</span><br>
<span class="louis">Is everything alright?</span><br>
It's weird for them to be this noisy.<br>
<span class="angel">My ring slipped behind the oven.</span><br>
<span class="joe">How'd it even get back there?</span><br>
<span class="angel">I-I don’t know! It just slipped off, and I just wanted to make us something nice for breakfast! Ugh. I can’t reach it, and Doctor Koch-</span><br>
<span class="joe">Joe.</span><br>
<span class="angel">It feels weird to call you that!! You're, like, my boss.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Lou calls me Joe.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Isn't he YOUR boss?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Um, I might be able to reach it? If you could just step aside, please.</span><br>
Joe would’ve never been able to get his arm under there. He has fat fingers.<br>
<span class="louis">Oh! I think I've got it.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Really? Thank you! I was worried we’d have to move the whole thing.</span><br>
I got to put it back on his finger. His hands are so soft. Ugh. I always know when Joe’s staring. There’s something about his gaze, it’s HEAVY. Yes, yes, that’s a good word for it. Heavy.<br>
Joe and Oak were getting ready for breakfast, but I’m not really hungry. My stomach’s been feeling weird lately. I just want to take a shower and unwind.<br>
Damn it. Someone’s already in there. I’ll just have to check again later, I guess.<br>
I think I’ve been in here for too long. I’m feeling dizzy. The steam makes my head feel funny, but it’s helping a lot with the headache. Even my hand’s calmed down a bit. I could melt in this shower and they’d find me a happy puddle.<br>
Well, a dead puddle. But I’d be happy either way.<br>
There’s a soft buzzing when you put your ear to the corner. It reminds me of those conch shells people listen to, where you can hear the ocean. Instead of waves, though, it’s just the white noise that comes with pipes and running water. It’s, ah, a lot more soothing than it sounds.<br>
<span class="lord"><span class="tran">Blue hands.</span></span><br>
That’s. I turn the water off. That was a voice. That was a voice? No. No, I’m just stressed. My head hurts, and I’m not thinking straight with all the steam. That was just a sign to get out and get back to work.<br>
Oak was rather sweet today. After some more studies on that residue, he asked if I wanted to have dinner with him and Joe. To be honest, I haven’t had much of an appetite lately. He just looked so earnest and excited, I had to sit with them. I ate as best as I could. It was good food, great. Something with sweet potatoes, I wasn’t really paying attention. I liked it though, even if it made my stomach worse.<br>
<span class="joe">We had to move XX53 to check his cell.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Did you try my camera idea out?</span><br>
<span class="joe">Yes, no dice. We can get photos for some reason though.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Oh. How are you watching him, then...?</span><br>
<span class="joe">We’re just having rounds until we can figure something out. Plus we can get a consistent photograph about every ten minutes, so we’ve got eyes on those as well. I’m thinking we need more security on him, I don’t like that he’s this active.</span><br>
I’m not great at jumping in. I let them talk around me, focusing on their voices. Joe always sounds congested, or maybe that he smoked when he was younger. It’s subtle, but it looks like it hurts to talk. Oak has such a rich voice, though. The quality is staggering. I’ve been trying to put my finger on it, he has SOME vague accent. It’s close to American English, but it definitely isn’t British or Aussie. He sounds... maybe a little French? I’m not good at accents. It’s driving me nuts. His ID’s on the table face up, but his last name doesn’t help much. “Wilson.” I don’t know where that’s from.<br>
#1021000777. 1021. That’s my angel number. His face looks a little softer than I remembered. My stomach is really churning now.<br>
<span class="angel">Is it ok?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Yes, yes, I’m sorry. I haven’t been feeling very hungry lately, but it’s very good.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Don't eat yourself sick.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Yeah, we can always save the leftovers.</span><br>
<span class="louis">You're right, I'm sorry.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Do you need to lie down?</span><br>
<span class="louis">I don’t know what I need, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Here, I'll take him to his room.</span><br>
<span class="joe">I’ll clean up, then. Thanks for dinner.</span><br>
<span class="louis">No, it's fine. I'm fine.</span><br>
He walked me down anyway. It’s weird, being this close. I try to keep back from everyone. I feel like they wouldn’t like me much if they saw me up close. It’s so nice though, feeling hands on my shoulders. Warm hands. Safe hands. Things are getting better.<br>
<span class="angel">Are you allowed to take a day off or something? Doctor Koch could take over till you’re feeling better.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I can still work. I’m getting better.</span><br>
<span class="angel">How's your hand?</span><br>
I should’ve stopped him. He held my hand so tight, I could feel that pain try to squirm out of his grip. I made such a stupid noise, I sounded like I was gagging. He finally let go.<br>
</p>

<div class="holdme">
    <p>
        <span class="angel">It’s still tender, huh?</span><br>
        <span class="louis">Please-. Please don't do that ever again.</span><br>
        <span class="angel">Ah! Sorry! I wasn't thinking!</span><br>
    </p>
</div>

<p>
He was still staring at my hand though, and held it a little gentler this time.<br>
<span class="angel">Doctor Garnier?</span><br>
<span class="louis">You can just call me Louis.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Your whole arm looks-.</span><br>
<span class="louis"><i><b>Stop touching me.</b></i></span><br>
He dropped it, thankfully. My head was starting to buzz.<br>
<span class="louis">Thank you.</span><br>
<span class="angel">I really think you need some rest. Is it ok if I talk with Doctor Koch about at least taking on some of your work? He keeps saying he’ll do it if you need him to.</span><br>
He’s already taken on a lot without me asking. Honestly even if I say no he’d probably do it regardless.<br>
A little rest would be nice.<br>
<span class="louis">If he’s comfortable with that, I won’t say no.</span><br>
<span class="angel">It’s important to take care of yourself.</span><br>
Stop smiling at me like that. It makes me feel strange.<br>
I’ve never been in a relationship. I was planning on dying alone. Not in some morbid, sob-story fashion, I just think some people aren’t meant to be around others. Some people just aren’t meant to love, and I was satisfied by that. But when I think about Oak, it feels a lot like how people say they feel about the people they love. I’m so disconnected from these feelings though. They hardly seem like my own, but I don’t know if it’s just because they’re new? I don’t even know if this is just me wanting a friend, or. Is there an or? There probably isn’t. He’s married, isn’t he?<br>
I’ve liked people before, but it was always distant ones. They were either a celebrity who’d never know my name, or people who just weren’t real. I watched too many movies in school, and it’s completely ruined my expectations. I’m a high maintenance person; I doubt anyone could truly satisfy me. But that’s the thing. Oak doesn’t feel real. I don’t think of him like a real person. Jesus, that sounds bad, I-I mean I think of him in high regards. He feels above average? Above. Above human? No, that’s not the way. I can’t think right now.<br>
None of these thoughts really matter anyway. He’s at the very least taken, and I’d never make a move even if he wasn’t. Maybe that’s why I like him so much. He’s safe to admire.<br>
It’s inappropriate to think this about a coworker. I need to get my head out of the gutter. A chat with XX[REDACTED] would be nice, if I can get down there.<br>
Unfortunately, with all the camera troubles, Joe’s been down in the holding area almost daily now. I’m getting restless. He gets strange with me when I try to help him.<br>
<span class="louis">Do you need help with anything?</span><br>
<span class="joe">You're supposed to be resting.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I feel a bit useless right now, is all.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Why don’t you take care of some filing or something? Take it easy.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Ah. Ok.</span><br>
I was hoping we could trade jobs. What’s he even doing down here? I thought we already had a security plan in action.<br>
Filing makes my head hurt. But Joe’s been very kind, if not a little distant, so the least I could do was take care of these folders for him. I don’t know who’s worse at organizing their papers, Brian or Kevin. Well, these from Oak are a bit scattered too. Jesus, his handwriting is so poor. Shame. I wouldn’t have guessed that looking at him.<br>
He’s from somewhere in California if I’m remembering right. And he used to live on a farm, Joe mentioned something about that. Man. His parents were hippies AND farmers. I’m not even sure how he wound up in this field of work.<br>
Ah, field. That’s kind of funny. I wonder if he’d laugh at that? Or would it be mean to say? I’m not even sure if he still talks with his family.<br>
I don’t.<br>
I cut all contact when my sister Sherry entered the convent. I mean, I was planning on ditching them for a while, but. Well. It’s difficult to explain. My father emailed me out of the blue a few months ago about needing a donor for a kidney transplant. We hadn’t spoken for nearly a decade before that. I never emailed him back, and no one’s tried to reach out since. And I’d really like to keep it that way.<br>
Maybe his parents are nice. Californians are nice, I think. Right? That’s the, uh, soft state, right? Always blue in the polls? I’m not a super political person, but when I was younger I always “leaned” left just to be contrarian at dinner. That’s a bit selfish. I just. I don’t have the energy to actually care what’s happening.<br>
If they’re farmers, they have to be strong. Oak’s a scrawny thing, though, so that doesn’t make much sense. Maybe they had a falling out. Maybe they kicked him out? Maybe he ran away. Aw. He probably doesn’t have anywhere to go.<br>
Oh. Maybe he ran off with his lover? And that’s why he has the ring?<br>
God, my head hurts. My hand’s actually been feeling a bit better, there’s just this. This pain behind the eyes. I took some advil this morning, but I felt so sick I threw it all up an hour later. No one caught me in the bathroom, thank god. I don’t want to get back to the constant babysitting from Joe.<br>
Although, I have had to be more careful. I’ve been getting a lot of comments on my left arm. It’s not like I’m trying to show it off, I wear my turtlenecks with the sleeves rolled down; sometimes though, people will catch a glimpse at my palm, or my wrist, or even lower arm. I’m fucking terrified. I don’t want to get in trouble; they don’t understand what’s happening to me, and if I tried to tell them I doubt they’d believe me. So I’ve been trying out different methods that might keep them off my back.<br>
First of all, no scalpel. Too damn risky, though I keep him in my bag. It does help with the pain in my hand, and I can always just hide it with the bandaging I already have. But for the rest of my arm, I’ve been using a blue ball-point pen. It’s a nice bright color, so people know I’m just drawing on my arm. I make marks where I think it would’ve helped to make an incision, mainly little strokes along the back of my hand. I make Xs on my fingers. It’s actually really helpful, and it does dull the pain weirdly enough. I think panicking makes it hurt worse, and this helps calm me down. It isn’t perfect, but it’s easy to wash off and explain away. Though people are still worried about my hand not healing yet.<br>
<span class="angel">Doctor Koch?</span><br>
Oak is standing outside my door. Well, Joe’s door.<br>
<span class="louis">Doctor Garnier, actually. Joe's downstairs working on the cameras.</span><br>
He made a weird face, not quite frightened but a little more than confused.<br>
<span class="louis">He knows I’m in here if you’re worried about that.</span><br>
<span class="angel">No, no. Just-. How did you even get in here?</span><br>
<span class="louis">What? He let me borrow his key. I’m allowed in here, you know. I, uh, am his boss.</span><br>
That feels weird to say.<br>
<span class="angel">No, I mean we were just-. Ah. Forget it, sorry. What’re you doing in his office, though?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Just helping him with some filing. These papers are a mess.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Yeesh. Yeah, Keith actually dropped those.</span><br>
<span class="louis">You mean Kevin?</span><br>
<span class="angel">No, no, Kevin swapped with Keith cause he didn’t feel like doing surveillance, it was a whole thing.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Well, he did NOT put these in the right order.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Let me take a look, I think I remember how we had these set up.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It's fine-.</span><br>
But he was already at it, carefully flicking through the pages. His hands are so steady, I don’t know how his penmanship turned out so poor.<br>
<span class="louis">Forgive me, but your ring, it’s-.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Do you want to hold it?</span><br>
<span class="louis">If you don't mind.</span><br>
I studied it carefully for any kind of name or inscription. It was gold, with a floral engraving all around the band dotted with small sapphires. Certainly expensive, but didn’t tell me much. God, the metal is still warm from his skin. When he turned to focus back on his papers, I brought it to my lips.<br>
<span class="big">What the fuck do you think you’re doing.</span><br>
I quickly gave it back to him.<br>
<span class="louis">It's stunning, Oak.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Isn't it? My father was so lucky.</span><br>
What? What? What? Excuse me?<br>
<span class="louis">Father?</span><br>
<span class="angel">This used to belong to my dad. My mother gave it to him for their anniversary.</span><br>
He took a long pause, but I egged him on as best as I could with my gaze. I had to know. I had to.<br>
<span class="angel">But my mother passed, and then my father followed a few years later. And he wanted me to keep it. I wear it every day, it feels like they’re both right with me.</span><br>
<span class="louis">That’s so-. Oak, I’m so sorry.</span><br>
He isn't married.<br>
Not that that matters!! I was just. I just wanted to know. I just wanted to know. This is a good sign, if anything. He trusts me enough to open up to me about it. That’s good. This is a good thing.<br>
<span class="louis">So, ah. Why do you wear it on your, ah, left hand? That’s your ring finger.</span><br>
<span class="angel">When I was in college I was working a few jobs, and the absolute worst was this waitressing gig. Waitering? I don’t know the word. I was a waiter. But there was this coworker and no matter how many times I complained my boss just would not fire her. She, ah, was nice enough, but I wasn’t going to date her or anything. It drove her nuts. Anyway, I just started wearing my ring like this, and, uh...</span><br>
He held his hand up, laughing a little.<br>
<span class="angel">She eventually knocked it off. I had a whole fake wife and everything. Thank god I was only there for a few years, I don’t think I’ve could’ve kept that lie up for long. But, you know, it feels weird not to wear it like this now. I like it this way, it just feels right.</span><br>
<span class="louis">That’s horrible. I’m so sorry she bothered you like that.</span><br>
<span class="angel">It’s fine, it was years ago. Besides, it makes for a funny story, right?</span><br>
I laughed because he laughed, but it really isn’t funny. You deserve nice hands, Oak. Gentle hands. Polite hands.<br>
Things will get better.<br>
</p>
<div class="isaac">
    <p>
        I keep having weird dreams. I think it’s just because I haven’t been able to see the cannies, but they’ve been appearing more often than they probably should. Last night was particularly strange.<br>
        XX53 was dressed in strange clothes, and he held onto xx19 so tight. They were swaying in an odd way, like dancing. He was mumbling something against her skin, but I couldn’t quite make it out. I don’t think they knew I was there. It was fascinating. It was warm, I was warm. I’m not sure where we were. Probably the basement. Wet and warm. The basement. Floor B3. Deep under ground. Warm.<br>
        But then he looked right at me.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
I feel sick to my stomach today. I think I might stay in bed. But I don't want another dream. I force myself into the hallway.<br>
Joe’s finally having another call with his daughter. I feel like it’s been ages since I’ve saw XX[REDACTED]. I miss our chats.<br>
Ah. I just realized. In all the new trouble I really haven’t been keeping up with the other two. I know Joe picks up my slack, but. Well. Did he this time? He usually says something, cause he hates dealing with them. And if we weren’t looking after them, then.<br>
No, no. There’s always surveillance. They’re fine, I’m sure, probably just confused why I haven’t been seeing them much. Things are getting better. We can get back on schedule soon.<br>
XX92 had been particularly neglected. I always try and find time for my dear [REDACTED], XX19 always has someone checking on her with her new eye condition, and I never have much of a chance to speak with XX53 alone. He prefers it that way, though, and I’d rather not interfere with his mental state when he’s clearly going through a lot of pain. Studies from afar is fine for me, and fine for him. XX92, though, I really think he needs me. He’s fresh, and he’s a frightened little thing. It’s horrible, but he slips my mind a lot.<br>
He just. He looks like a normal person. In my head, he’s like a coworker I pay no mind. His face is purely average, features very human; he was in Georgia for 62 years before he was found out. Well, not him. Something inside him. HIS name is Rhoades. XX92 is something inside him. That’s all we really know right now.<br>
He had a family. He had a son. He’s well-meaning enough. When I can get a good conversation in with him he talks a lot about that boy; Sedric.<br>
“He wanted to go to a big fancy college outta town, scared the shit out of me.”<br>
“He spent all his time on the computer, and he got real good at programing. It’s programing, right? That's what they call it?” I wouldn’t know.<br>
“Did he send any letters? Hey, did he send any letters? You said they could send me letters.” He doesn’t.<br>
He gets pathetic when I have to tell him that. He’s a very physical man. I like that about him. He cries a lot, and he likes to hug when he cries. I don’t hug him, but I let him hold me.<br>
We wanted to get XX92 out of him by the spring, but studies have been vastly delayed. The few we had done were, ah, inconclusive. He didn’t respond well to being put under the knife either. Recovery time was thrice as high as the others, even XX53 who was constantly undergoing operation. It’s concerning, but I’ve gone out of my way to keep him from seeing any panic. I think he knows, though. He has to. It’s inside him.<br>
I was hoping to give XX53 a visit again—he’s been on my mind for some reason—but I think Rhoades needs more engagement. I’m sure he could use someone to talk to, and he responds better to familiar faces. I think he likes me a lot. He said I remind him of Sedric.<br>
<span class="louis">Hey, Rhoades?</span><br>
The glass is a bit murky, and the lights are getting dim again. Gotta get Diane on the phone, don’t forget that. I write it quickly on my arm.<br>
<span class="louis">I'm coming in, alright?</span><br>
Still being human, he has no issues with communication. He’s pretty much the only one the coms are useful for, except maybe for making some noise so they aren’t frightened when the door suddenly opens.<br>
<span class="louis">I’m sorry it’s been so long, we’ve been busy. I hope you weren’t too lonely, haha.</span><br>
<br> <br> <br>
<span class="bigbigbig"><b>He hung himself.</b></span><br>
He. His body. His back was to me, dangling limp. His gown was torn up. I don’t. There’s nowhere to HANG off of. The ceiling is flat. The ceiling is flat. This is. That can’t. He didn’t. No. No. It’s too dark to see. But his body is there. I have eyes I can fucking see. He’s hanging. He’s limp. He’s dead.<br>
Fuck.<br>
Fuck, I’m fucked. I’m so fucked. This is my fault.<br>
I’m gonna lose my job.<br>
I talk to [REDACTED] once a week. I haven’t thought about Rhoades all month. His holding has just been watched for any self-harm and breech concerns. And even then, we’ve been so focused on XX53. I’m. I’ve been the only person checking on him. I was. He isn’t. He can’t be checked on any more.<br>
<span class="louis">Joe? Joe, please? Joe?</span><br>
I knocked till he opened up, looking frustrated but concerned.<br>
<span class="joe">Did something happen?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Rhoades hung himself.</span><br>
<span class="joe">What? When?!</span><br>
<span class="louis">I-I-I don’t know! I just went down to check up on him, a-and-</span><br>
<span class="joe">I’m gonna kill Keith, he’s supposed to be on surveillance right now.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I don’t know what to do. I-I’m not even sure how he did it.</span><br>
Joe lets out a long, deep breath. I follow suit, trying to mimick the way his chest puffs out. It really didn't help much.<br>
<span class="joe">Maybe this is a good thing.</span><br>
<span class="louis">What?</span><br>
<span class="joe">We haven’t been getting anywhere with it. This’ll force XX92 to leave the host, though. It could be the breakthrough we’ve been waiting for.</span><br>
<span class="louis">That's-! That's a horrible thing to say!</span><br>
He's staring again. I can't take it.<br>
<span class="joe">Why aren’t you in your PPE?</span><br>
Oh. I guess I'm not.<br>
<span class="louis">I, ah, forgot, I guess. I'm sorry.</span><br>
<span class="joe">So you went down to do an in-person check-in, with no gear on.</span><br>
<span class="louis">That’s not important right now! We're gonna have to make a report, I-I don't even know what to tell them!</span><br>
<span class="joe">I’m checking with Keith.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I already told you, he's dead! I saw it!</span><br>
But he was already stomping down the hallway. I can’t tell if it was anger or panic, but either way he was faster.<br>
<span class="joe"><b>Move.</b></span><br>
I was rounding the corner when Keith was scurrying out. Goddamn it. Goddamn it, my hand. Joe tapped the screen with a tight closed fist.<br>
<span class="joe">That's dead?</span><br>
No, no, that’s. But I saw it. On the cameras he’s sitting like he normally does, head against the corner of the cell. I saw him hang. I saw him hang. I saw him hang.<br>
<span class="louis">Then. Then, then, then that's not him!</span><br>
<span class="joe">Then who is it?!</span><br>
<span class="louis">I don’t know! I saw him dead! Follow me, follow me, he’s hanging!</span><br>
I think I’m gonna vomit. I started running, and Joe kept pace behind me. Everyone’s staring, I can feel it. I run harder. I’m trying not to gag.<br>
<span class="joe">Lou, Lou-</span><br>
<span class="louis">Just follow, me please! I can show you-!</span><br>
<span class="joe">You're heading to the wrong floor!</span><br>
Stop. Don’t touch me. He pulled me back by my arm, and I nearly hit my head on the railing. It hurts.<br>
<span class="louis">O-Ow-</span><br>
<span class="joe">We moved him with the others. He’s on B1.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Please let go.</span><br>
Fuck, my hand. Even after he let go, my whole left arm was burning.<br>
<span class="joe">You’re running blind all the way down the stairs without any PPE on. Rhoades is FINE.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I know what I saw.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Do you know what's actually there?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Just look. Please. Please, just look.</span><br>
<span class="joe">If I look you have to show me your arm.</span><br>
<span class="big"><i>Fuck you.</i></span><br>
<span class="joe">Please, dear god, just get some rest. Don’t work, just lie in bed. Take a shower-.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I DON’T FUCKING SMELL.</span><br>
My whole body just erupted. I felt every muscle untense. My legs buckled, and I nearly fell over.<br>
<span class="joe">Don't yell at me.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Why don't you brush your teeth?</span><br>
<span class="joe big">WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!</span><br>
Joe was grabbing my arm again. I feel like. I think I'm falling. I pulled back, but he wouldn't let me fall. Please. Please stop.<br>
<span class="joe">I can’t help you if you won’t tell me what’s going on! I’m not a therapist, but Christ you can only pull so much shit before I have to report you!</span><br>
<span class="louis">I-I'm gonna-</span><br>
<span class="joe">You’re scaring me, and I just want you to be ok. It’s ok to rest, and if you aren’t going to manage this yourself then I think we need to get other people involved.</span><br>
My stomach. My, my stomach.<br>
<span class="louis">J-</span><br>
<span class="joe">This job isn’t worth breaking down. You aren't yourself. For Christ's sake you’re cutting-</span><br>
I threw up. My legs gave out, and we were both drenched in vomit.<br>
<span class="joe">LOUIS!</span><br>
He shoved me against the wall, but I guess he felt bad afterwards. He was helping me back up right away. We just sat together in the dark, the stairs slick with bile.<br>
<span class="louis">Well now we both smell.</span><br>
His laugh is still ugly.<br>
<span class="louis">I'm sorry I yelled.</span><br>
<span class="joe">We were both yelling.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Yeah.</span><br>
<span class="joe">I don’t want to force you into anything, and I definitely don’t want you to lose your job. So this is what’s going to happen.</span><br>
He pushes his shoulder a little firmer against me, pressing me into the wall. It feels strange.<br>
<span class="joe">I’m telling everyone you’re doing some big study, and that they are not to bother you. If they have any issues, ANY, they come to me for the week. If anyone tries bothering you, tell me. I’ll make sure they listen. You are going to rest in your room, and if you want to get out of the dorms you can sit in my office. Eat with the others, if they ask about the study tell them it’s just related to Rhoades. They won’t question that much, and if they do I’ll make sure they stop. Ok?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Why are you doing this?</span><br>
<span class="joe">Because I know you can get through this. And I want to help you do it, I really do. But you have to help YOURSELF, and I’m going to put you in a position where you can. Give me a couple days to get everyone off your back, and then relax for the next week. And I mean RELAX, if I catch you down here or messing around in the labs you’re going to get more than a little hell for it.</span><br>
I’m lucky. I’m too lucky. This isn’t fair, this isn’t deserved. I don’t understand how he can be so kind to me now. Has he always been this nice to me? It’s so hard to tell with him.<br>
I did try. I did try a few times to tell him about my hand. But it’s about more than that, right? Whenever I try to speak, it’s like my throat closes up. No, Joe’s right. He’s giving me the chance to deal with this myself.<br>
I wanted to use this time to try and get back into art. I was able to paint a little in high school, and in college there was this nice course on technical drawing. Mm. I haven’t kept up with it though. It’s easy to go through the motions of those courses. I make the guides, the circles, I place where shapes should go. I loved drawing faces. I used to be so good at it. All the fine arts teachers knew me in college, they said I had so much talent. I wish I listened. I really do.<br>
Eugh. I’m no good without a reference. Joe has a photo of him and his daughter in his desk drawer, and I can do their headshots alright. I used to be able to draw right from memory. I could make people up in my head and they’d become real. It’s bullshit. I don’t even like research that much.<br>
There was a classroom I liked to linger in. I wasn’t allowed in after class since I wasn’t a Fine Arts major, but she’d leave the door unlocked often. Mondays and Wednesdays I’d sit inside that room right before getting dinner. There was a chair propped up by the window, and I’d sit and study the room. I liked that it was dark, and quiet. You could hear the pipes running. It was incredible.<br>
I often set dates in college. I’d pick a day, or maybe have a bad dream about a date, and then I’d just wait for that day to come. And on that day, I would ask myself,<br>
Do I want to kill myself?<br>
And if I said yes, I would in that very classroom. And if not, I would keep pushing forward.<br>
I only said yes once. I wasn’t meant to live past Halloween of my sophomore year. I remember distinctly that night I had a horrible dream. A church dream. It was almost a sign. And I was just, well, done. And I had a feeling all that month that it would be my last. I used up all my money on my meal plan, I ate good, I gave a lot of things away to my friends as gifts. I was ready. I bought a good, sturdy rope, because the beams in the studio could hold my weight well. And I was going to hang myself in that classroom. It was supposed to be empty. It always had been before.<br>
The professor had stayed late that day though. Well, she came back onto campus because she forgot her binder, but she was here. And she talked with me, and told me how happy she was I had taken on another course with her. I wanted to break every bone in my body. She was so kind, so earnest. She thought I was something special. She thought I had worth.<br>
Life goes on. Halloween came and went. I was alive. I still am.<br>
I hadn’t thought about that day in a while. Jesus. Whenever I try to rest, all these things just hit my mind. When I’m not fretting about the present, I’m fretting about the future. And when I can’t do that, I just get upset about the past. Maybe I should just go back to bed. I could get a shower...<br>
<span class="angel">Doctor Garnier? Can I come in?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Only if you stop with the formalities.</span><br>
<span class="angel">I’ll try. I just wanted to check up on you, Louis.</span><br>
My name rolls off his tongue so naturally. His voice is like silver. I shift in my seat.<br>
<span class="louis">Joe’s got you babysitting me?</span><br>
<span class="angel">He actually asked me to give you a little space, but I worry, haha. Ah, don’t tell him I was in here.</span><br>
He sits across from me, hands up on the table. I wasn’t quick enough to hide my paper; he’s holding it up in the light, fumbling for the switch on Joe’s desk lamp.<br>
<span class="angel">Did you draw this?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Yeah. It’s a bit of a mess, though.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Are you blind? This looks good!</span><br>
<span class="louis">That one was with a reference.</span><br>
<span class="angel">It’s Doctor Koch, right?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Joe, yes.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Wow. Now I feel shy, haha.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Oh?</span><br>
<span class="angel">I wouldn’t have shown you my scribbles if I knew I was talking with a real artist.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Don’t say that. They were beautiful.</span><br>
<span class="angel">You're too nice.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I think you are.</span><br>
I lean forward to take it back, and our hands brush against each other. Skin on skin. Skin on bandage. My palm burns, but I try not to let it show.<br>
<span class="louis">Do you believe in angel numbers?</span><br>
<span class="angel">I do, actually.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Do you know today’s date?</span><br>
<span class="angel">It’s, um. It’s the 21st, right?</span><br>
<span class="louis">October 21st. 1021.</span><br>
His body tensed all of a sudden. Our hands are still pressed against each other.<br>
<span class="angel">That's my number!</span><br>
<span class="louis">It's your ID.</span><br>
<span class="angel">No, this is so crazy. I’ve been dreaming about that number nonstop. Oh man. I’ve got the chills.</span><br>
<span class="louis">You’ve got such a nice laugh.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Oh, really? It’s a bit loud.</span><br>
<span class="louis">You know, I’ve been dreaming about that number too. Almost weekly now.</span><br>
<span class="angel">That's crazy!</span><br>
<span class="louis">Do you know what it means?</span><br>
<span class="angel">It’s all about new beginnings. I read on some sites it’s a sign of good change! Radical change even.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It could mean a few things, good things. It could mean. It could mean, um. I-It could mean...</span><br>
I lean forward, holding tight onto his hand. His ring is warm from flushed skin. I rub my thumb against each gem carefully, taking in the texture. The cut on these are phenomenal. They suit these hands well.<br>
<span class="angel">Louis?</span>

<p>
<span class="louis">Hey, Joe?</span><br>
I was restless this morning. I wanted to eat with Keith again, since he spoke with me yesterday at dinner. After that huge outburst, I don’t blame him for getting worried. It was, ah, uncharacteristically sweet of him, but he hasn’t really paid me much mind since I cleared the air. I guess I prefer it that way, but I’m feeling a bit lonely. I would’ve eaten with Oak, but I just can’t find him. Not in his room, not in any of the labs. It’s weird.<br>
<span class="joe">Everything ok?</span><br>
<span class="louis">I’m just feeling a little, ah, lonely.</span><br>
He clicks his tongue, nodding. I hate how he stares.<br>
<span class="louis">I did catch a shower this morning! When I got out, though, I think everyone had already eaten breakfast. The kitchen was empty.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Do you want to get breakfast tomorrow?</span><br>
<span class="louis">That would be nice.</span><br>
<span class="joe">It’s good to eat together. I’ll see if Oak wants to join.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Have you seen him, by the way? He’s usually floating around, but I just can’t seem to catch him.</span><br>
<span class="joe">I have not, but he should be in Lab 3A.</span><br>
<span class="louis">He isn’t, I looked.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Mm. I’ll ask him about it later.</span><br>
I linger by his side a little longer.<br>
<span class="joe">Well, uh, you go relax now.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Can I draw you, Joe?</span><br>
<span class="joe">What?</span><br>
<span class="louis">I wanted to start drawing again, and I’d really like to draw you. You have a very... angular face, yes. Your nose has such a strong shape too. You’ll make a handsome sketch, yes.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Stop saying embarrassing things.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I won’t be in the way. You can work around me, honest.</span><br>
<span class="joe">I can’t exactly stop you.</span><br>
His voice was wavering. It’s so strangely enthralling, catching Joe off guard.<br>
<span class="louis">Oh, Joe-.</span><br>
<span class="joe">I really don't have the energy for games.</span><br>
He turns, though I can still make out his profile. I do think his nose is his best feature. A strong, roman nose, all sharp angles. He’d look quite catching if he took better care of himself.<br>
Don’t think that. What a horrible thought. I’m not much of a charmer myself. Though my teeth are straight. Shut up. Stop it. He has a charming face. He has a handsome nose. That’s a charming look. It gives him character. It suits him. Some men make ugly look good. He does. It’s fucking infuriating.<br>
What a profile, though. His brow was furrowed as he worked, eyes creased as he studied some wiring. He plays repairman well. My hands keep shaking. I feel strange.<br>
<span class="louis">You could just call Diane and let her send some people in to fix up the cameras.</span><br>
<span class="joe">They’re too slow, and they do a shit job. Besides, no one knows what we need better than we do. I’d rather cut out the middleman.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I guess.</span><br>
He keeps turning, trying to hide his face as subtly as he can. It’s obvious, though.<br>
<span class="louis">Are you alright? ...Joe?</span><br>
<span class="joe">Ah. Well. It’s not the kind of thing worth talking about.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It can’t be that bad.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Just some complicated feelings.</span><br>
<span class="louis">That's perfectly normal.</span><br>
I try to goad him on further, but he’s gone quiet again.<br>
<span class="louis">It’ll be fine, Joe.</span><br>
<span class="joe">The time for prevalence has come.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It has, yes.</span><br>
<span class="joe">It has. It has.</span><br>
Nodding slowly, he’s finally facing me again. Lips are still tight pressed into a thin line, but his eyes are a little kinder. My palm is burning.<br>
<span class="louis">Hey, Joe?</span><br>
<span class="joe">Yeah?</span><br>
<span class="louis">I was just curious. Why did you fall into this line of work? You, ah, don’t look like the science type, yet you have such a natural knack for research.</span><br>
<span class="joe">I don’t know. It’s always felt like my calling. I’ve always thought<span class="bigbigbig2">we are more under submission to the greats.</span></span><br>
<span class="louis">What?</span><br>
<span class="joe">It’s just a subject I like, I guess. It keeps me busy, too. I like being busy.</span><br>
Busy is good. My palm is burning. There’s something. There’s something moving, and I think he knows it. He’s making a face. I bite my tongue, trying to keep my hand steady.<br>
<span class="joe">The time for prevalence is here, though.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It certainly is. I-I’m sorry, I need to step away for a moment.</span><br>
<span class="joe">It will come out soon.</span><br>
What. What? Hey. Hey, what are you talking about? Hey? I was holding my hand up, expecting him to see something. His face is still unreadable.<br>
<span class="joe">This will pass. Things just need to pass.</span><br>
<span class="louis">This will pass. Yes, yes, this will pass.</span><br>
<span class="joe">This will pass.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It will pass.</span><br>
<span class="joe">It will come out soon.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It will come out soon.</span><br>
<span class="joe">It will come out soon.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It will come out soon.</span><br>
<span class="joe">It will come out soon.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It will come out soon. Hey. Hey. Can you see this?</span><br>
You can see this right? Hey? Hey. Look. Look at my hand. You can see this, right? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey?<br>
He tastes so good. My legs grew weak the moment I was touching Oak. He radiates warmth, down to his lips. They’re chapped, but in a way that’s exciting. Even his flaws make my body burn.<br>
I kissed him. It was only for a few seconds, my ribs aching from leaning over the table at an odd angle. What a pain. I’ll cherish it forever.<br>
He hadn’t necessarily jumped back. Not quite a bunny hop, more a gentle push. I sank into my chair, and he was still firmly in his place. His hand was now covering his mouth. God, that ring against his pale skin, now against a flushed face. I shifted to hide myself.<br>
<span class="angel">Oh no. Oh no.</span><br>
He kept muttering that into his hand. I think I’m in love. This is what love is supposed to feel like. It makes you want to vomit, break every bone in your body. I’d kill myself if I could right now. I press bandaged palm to skin, soaking in the pain as the bones of his fingers pressed gauze deep into my wound. My head is buzzing. I feel high.<br>
<span class="louis">Angel-.</span><br>
<span class="angel">I'm so sorry.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Angel, please. Kiss me again.</span><br>
<span class="angel">I can’t, I can’t. It’s not right.</span><br>
<span class="louis">But it feels like heaven.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Doctor Garnier. Stop, please.</span><br>
Why? Why? I could feel my body falling, sinking into Joe’s leather chair. My hand slithers down the wood, now resting at my lap. He takes a deep breath, and I follow suit, our lungs in perfect sync. God.<br>
<span class="angel">I’m sorry, I just know you aren’t feeling yourself. I don’t want to take advantage of you, not when you’re this vulnerable.</span><br>
<span class="louis">You don't need to make things up.</span><br>
<span class="angel">It’s not made up, Louis. I don't know what to say, this just doesn’t feel right. We need to revisit this when we’re both feeling ok.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I'm not sick, if that's what you think.</span><br>
<span class="angel">You’re clearly going through a hard time, though.</span><br>
<span class="louis">You can’t trust what Joe says about me, he doesn’t know me, Oak.</span><br>
<span class="angel">I-?! Louis, you’ve been unhinged for days now! And that’s fine, that’s valid, you need space to cope. But I’m not going to trust what you say when your head is in a completely different space from when we met.</span><br>
<span class="louis">You don't trust me?</span><br>
<span class="angel">I used the wrong word, I don’t mean it like that. Look, I really don’t want to hurt you. Please, just trust me on this. I promise we can address this down the line. For now, I’m going to pretend this never happened. Do the same, please. We can get dinner tonight and let things be normal. Ok?</span><br>
I nodded. He left with a nervous smile, closing the door behind him.<br>

<p>
How am I supposed to clean this up? Joe’s table has some ugly stains now. I’ll say I spilled coffee. He’ll be upset, but hopefully not too angry with me. I cleaned it up as best as I could. I’ll just have to avoid his office. Sitting in my room shouldn’t be too bad, it was just nice to have somewhere new to rest. I roll my sleeve back down. Thank god I’m in room 17.<br>
I’ve been drinking more caffeine. When I’m asleep, I have horrible nightmares. They aren’t all church dreams. Sometimes I dream I’m on the bus. Sometimes I dream I’m on my way home. I’ve been followed, I’ve been on a boat. I’ve been watched. I’ve been online. I’ve been on a computer. I’ve been in a computer. Oh that’s funny, but if I said that aloud I don’t think anyone would laugh.<br>
The caffeine doesn’t stop me from sleeping much, but it makes my dreams weirder. I’ll take weird over horrifying. I had the foggiest one last night, where Joe let me sketch out his face but it always turned into nonsense. You know Picasso? That style, just, you know, worse. And he got so fed up with me, he broke my nose. And then we laughed. The day went on. I woke up to a nosebleed, which was funny. But when I told Joe he didn’t laugh.<br>
Coffee-Fueled Dream Joe is a lot funnier. That’s not the word. Expressive? He smiles when he’s happy, he groans when he’s frustrated, even his clothes are funny. Tight red leather, and I never question it when I’m asleep. I guess in that world it’s just expected for Joe to walk around in heels. Whatever.<br>
I like these dreams. I’ve been drinking more caffeine. I like Dream Joe, and Dream Oak. Soft Oak. So soft. Real Oak has been keeping his distance, but Dream Oak presses himself against my shoulder. And he and I and Dream Joe will eat nonsense foods and say nonsense words, nonsense numbers.<br>
<span class="lord">It'll get better, doctor!</span><br>
<span class="soft">It’ll get better!</span><br>
<span class="redacted">We’re only here till November.</span><br>
<span class="soft">That’s the day! That’s the day!</span><br>
<span class="lord">Doctor, doctor!</span><br>
<span class="redacted">Oh darling, I’m starved.</span><br>
<span class="soft">No no no, we’re starved, we’re all starved!</span><br>
<span class="lord">I’ll start with you, and you, and you. A burning wheel. Right on the table.</span><br>
<span class="soft">Deep underground, right on the table!</span><br>
<span class="redacted">Right on the table, strap me down!</span><br>
Ah. The coffee was supposed to keep me up, but I’ve been eager to get back to bed and see them again. I haven’t been excited to sleep in a long time.<br>
The week off was nice. Aside from a little incident, something about a table stain? I don’t quite recall, my mind has been jumbled; but aside from that, I think it really helped. The coffee is nice too. Oh, so nice. I drink it black, fill up a nice big flask and drink it in the morning, at lunch, dinner. It’s great, it’s great. Sometimes I hear things from the corners of rooms, but it’s just the coffee. Oh it’s good coffee. They had this special Christmas blend, Sugar Cookie. Sweet but black. Dark, black. Warming my palm. Sometimes I’ll use the cup as a heating pad and hold it in my bad hand. It doesn’t do much, but I like it.<br>
<span class="lord"><span class="tran">Angel.</span></span><br>
I’ve been avoiding sitting near any corners. There’s this. I hear. Ah, it’s not real, don’t get me wrong. I know it’s not real. I’m not crazy. There’s just this little whispering. It’s unavoidable in the shower, but if I make the water real hot it’s easier to dismiss. It burns.<br>
You know, I’ve always wondered what it’s like to be boiled alive. I love crabs. I’ve always been a fan of seafood. But my father used to have us go crabbing, and he’d make me help him boil the crabs. I hated that part. It probably feels a lot worse than this. I’ve been showering in hotter and hotter water. I like feeling dizzy from the steam. I feel like I’m melting. It hurts, but it’s so blissful. It’s been messing with my left hand a lot, but it almost feels like. Like justice. I’m not supposed to be doing things that make it hurt. I’ve gotten everyone so upset.<br>
Oak’s been a little more distant with me, a little curt too. At least Joe’s been a bit gentler on me. I need gentle right now. My head is in knots. He doesn’t like me drinking all this coffee, but he hasn’t said anything directly. Just little jabs. Which is fine.<br>
<span class="big">It’s better than before, right? Sit down and let me drink.</span><br>
Stop, stop. He’s being kind. He’s a kind man. I miss Oak. I miss him so bad. How do I even ask what’s wrong though? He’s still being polite. Maybe I’m just misreading his signals.<br>
Oh dear. I just wanted to go get breakfast, but when I got into the kitchen Oak was crying his eyes out.<br>
<span class="louis">Is everything alright?</span><br>
<span class="angel">I c-can’t find it, it’s gone forever...</span><br>
<span class="joe">Don’t be silly. It’s somewhere in the building. We’ll find it eventually.</span><br>
Joe’s rubbing his back, holding him close. It’s a bit intimate for a superior to do to another researcher, isn’t it? Ah, now’s not the time to be presumptuous. I sit next to them, leaning a little into Oak.<br>
<span class="louis">Did something happen...?</span><br>
His hand is bare. My stomach drops.<br>
<span class="joe">His ring got lost.</span><br>
<span class="angel">I shouldn’t be wearing it around, it just makes me feel safe... I’m so fucking stupid, I’m so stupid.</span><br>
<span class="joe">It will work itself out. Everything will be fine.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Have you seen it Louis?! Please, I had it last night, and I really thought I put him away in my drawer. But now I’m not so sure, I-I can’t remember. Oh god. I had a shower last night, what if it’s down the drain?! Wh-what do we do?!</span><br>
<span class="joe">You wouldn’t have worn it in the shower. After I finish up downstairs I’ll help you look through your dresser, ok? And then we’ll retrace your steps.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Thank you, Joe. I'm so sorry.</span><br>
Why are they leaning against each other like that? I press myself in a little firmer, till I can feel the bones in our arms rubbing against each other. Fuck. I made a weird sound. Goddamn it. Don’t look at me like that, stop staring like you always do. I’d been pulled back for a few minutes now, but the air was still tense.<br>
<span class="louis">I could help search.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Ah. You know, Louis, you could cover some of Josef’s workload today? Then he could spend more time helping me.</span><br>
<span class="louis">If, ah, that’s what you’d like. It’s the least I could do.</span><br>
I don’t like leaving them alone together. Oak is so quick to grasp onto people, and Joe is so blunt in his emotions. It feels like a bad combination.<br>
I just don’t want them to get in trouble, is all. Honest. Save them the embarrassment, as well. It would be different if they were better at keeping it a secret. “It”? There’s no it. They aren’t doing anything. I just.<br>
They stare at each other in such an honest way. I wouldn’t mind if they looked at me like that.<br>
There’s a skeleton in Lab 10 A. He’s more of a joke prop than anything else, hung up with a lab coat draped over his boney arms. He wears a size M coat.<br>
I keep hearing laughter through the vents. I don’t think they’re even searching at this point. Joe’s just determined to keep him from crying. And that’s fine enough, it just feels a little MUCH. My stomach hurts. I should’ve asked Keith to help me with this sample. Being alone never does my mind any good.<br>
<span class="lord tran">Strap me in.</span><br>
Goddamn it, shut up. I finish off my flask of coffee, letting the metal warm my palm. My arm is itchy today. I slide my things further from the corner of the wall.<br>
<span class="lord tran">Doctor, doctor.</span><br>
It’s been a while since I’ve visited XX53, hasn’t it? I’m alone today too, and Joe’s busy playing around with Oak. This might actually not be a bad time to try and sneak another private session in. It might help get my mind off all the chatter. All the tapping. Every sound in this building makes me want to break my fingers.<br>
The cell hallway feels like it stretches longer and longer every time I come down. Cell 53 could be anywhere. I don’t quite recall where he’s at. Peering through the glass with nothing but a flashlight is difficult, but I’d rather not alarm anyone I’m down here again.<br>
Here he is. Cell 10, though it’s the 53rd because he’s in it. Is that right? Maybe Joe moved him again. I don’t know what he’s doing.<br>
<span class="louis">Hello.</span><br>
<span class="lord">Doctor, doctor.</span><br>
He’s sat in the corner again, though this time facing me. His face is still covered in bandages, and his throat looks scarred. The nails on his fingers had been filed down, but they grow back too fast to stop him from hurting himself. Joe was talking about removing them, I think we should just keep him bound to his bed. Not like he uses it anyway, always laying on the floor.<br>
<span class="louis">Doctor Garnier.</span><br>
<span class="lord">Eugh...</span><br>
<span class="louis">You look sick.</span><br>
<span class="lord">Doctor, doctor. Doctor.</span><br>
I sit by his side, and he sits up from his usual spot against the wall. He’s larger than me in every way, but not in a frightening manor. He’s childish in his clumsiness, not naïve but just stupid, not less than but just unequipped. I was zoning out, enjoying the quiet, when he grabbed my palm in one hand.<br>
I’m not in my PPE.<br>
I just realized that, his skin against mine. Boney fingers prod at my hand.<br>
<span class="louis">H-Hey...!</span><br>
<span class="lord">Doctor.</span><br>
You’re hurting me. Not that he’d understand that. When I pull back he tightens his grip, pressing fingers deep into my wound and pushing the pain throughout my entire arm. Fuck. Fuck, stop it. I can’t talk, just making weird gagging noises. My stomach hurts so bad. His throat makes a clicking noise as he looks over my hand.<br>
<span class="lord">Eye. Eyes.</span><br>
It’s moving. It’s moving. He digs his fingers through the bandages. It’s moving, I can feel my veins stretching around it. When a finger presses inside, I<br>
I<br>
I<br>
My lungs were burning. I was just. I started screaming, as loud as I could.<br>
<span class="lord">Doctor.</span><br>
No one came to help me.<br>
<span class="lord">Rotting. Your bones.</span><br>
It took too long for him to let go. No, not let go. I’m against the wall. But he’s out of my hand. He’s on my throat. It hurts less. His knee was in my ribs, hand on my throat. Not squeezing, not squeezing. Squeezing. Squeezing. Release and then. My neck. And then. My eyes are going to burst out my skull. My eyes. My eyes. Release. My neck. I can’t close my eyes. I can’t close my eyes. Release. My neck. My neck. My neck. Squeeze. Grip. Grip. Grip. Grip.<br>
My lungs stopped. My brain stopped. Just for a moment, but it was enough. I was seeing stars still when he sat up, still on my chest. I didn’t dare move. He pulled me up himself. I don’t know what’s going through his head.<br>
<span class="lord">Doctor?</span><br>
I’m dangling in his hands now. He’s holding me by my coat. I don’t understand what he wants. I keep quiet, and then his fingers were tearing at my wound again. Help me. Help me.<br>
<span class="louis">Help me.</span><br>
Ah. I didn’t even notice right away, my vision is still so blurry. But I was on the floor again. He crouches down, still holding onto my hand. And then he. And then he. And.<br>
<span class="lord">Gift.</span><br>
This is Oak’s ring. He was putting it on my finger, pressing me into the wall as hard as he could.<br>
<span class="louis">How do you-?</span><br>
He can’t answer that. When it was on firm, he gave a final shove, smacking my head against the metal walls. And then he was back in the corner, muttering to himself.<br>
My body felt like it was paralyzed. It was like he was still on top of me, I could feel the pressure of his hands where he was once touching me. I left eventually, as quietly as I could. He never even looked back at me. I stayed in my room the rest of the night.<br>
What the hell am I supposed to do? I’m still wearing Oak’s ring. When I go to take it off, my palm burns. It burns in the worst way possible, from deep under the skin. But if he sees me wearing it...<br>
It’s his ring, I need to give it back. But it feels so right on my hand. It’s like it’s meant to be there. I compromised, stringing it through a chain to wear under my turtleneck. It was enough to satiate my palm. I’ll give it back to him when I’m feeling better, I need it right now.<br>
I’m not often scheduled on surveillance, but I think Joe pulled some strings to get us both on a shift alone. Late at night, just the two of us with no worries of eaves dropping. I’d call it sweet in another life. He was sitting hunched over the table, staring intently into XX53’s camera footage. I still have no idea how he got it working.<br>
<span class="joe">He keeps sitting in that corner...</span><br>
<span class="louis">It's his favorite spot.</span><br>
Joe clicked his tongue, scribbling something onto a note. His penmanship is surprisingly elegant, considering his hands.<br>
<span class="joe">Still no luck with Oak’s ring.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Oh no. He must be heartbroken.</span><br>
<span class="joe">Extremely. But it has to be in this building. I just wish he’d calm down and actually look for it.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It is important to him, though. I think it’s one of a kind. I’d be upset too.</span><br>
I can picture his face already when I hand it back to him. He’d thank me over and over again. That’ll be a good day, whenever it comes.<br>
<span class="joe">True. ...Lou. Look, now XX19 is in the corner of it’s cell.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Do you think they're talking?</span><br>
It was just a joke, but Joe was nodding intently.<br>
<span class="joe">They do this a lot, I’ve noticed. I’m a little worried that’s what it’s trying to accomplish.</span><br>
<span class="louis">It’s nothing to worry about, though. If anything, it would make for a pretty astonishing discovery, right?</span><br>
<span class="joe">It would be, if they weren’t so dangerous.</span><br>
He leans forward, and I follow closely behind. He’s writing something down, a string of numbers.<br>
<span class="joe">Do you hear that?</span><br>
<span class="louis">What's happening?</span><br>
<span class="joe">It's saying something.</span><br>
<span class="louis">He likes to say words he remembers sometimes.</span><br>
He taps his pen to each screen. All four were in the corner now, even Rhoades who was usually asleep by now.<br>
<span class="joe">They're nodding along. They can hear it.</span><br>
Closer now. His ear is practically against the speaker, muffling the noise into something I can’t quite pick up. He was still frantically writing everything down.<br>
<span class="joe">It’s just a bunch of numbers. 98. 304. 12. 101. 121. 42. 3097. 4589. 1021.</span><br>
It’s been five minutes since he said that. 1021. The silence is worrying, but I don’t want to interrupt him. He hasn’t written a thing since, though.<br>
<span class="lord">1021.</span><br>
It comes out steady from the speaker now, and I finally look back to the cameras. XX53 was now standing straight, bandaged face looking right into the lens. Right into my eyes.<br>
<span class="lord">1021.</span><br>
Joe was still pressed against the speaker. I don’t think he’s conscious. Shaking him gently did nothing. He has a pulse, but his body won’t move. His eyes are blank, fluttering uselessly.<br>
I shouldn’t feel this calm.<br>
<span class="lord">Garnier.</span><br>
He’s calling me, I can hear him. Still staring at me, even when I look away, even with no eyes to stare. I rub our ring through my shirt. He wants me back in his cell, I can feel it. My palm is burning, I can already feel his hands inside me. Hands inside me.<br>
But Joe was posed against the table, all his muscles untensed and his jaw ever so slightly agape. His breath smells disgusting.<br>
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Please, forgive me. Please. I’m sorry.<br>
I shut the monitor down, and I take Joe from his seat, pressing him against the table. His neck bends at an uncomfortable angle, so I put down a chair cushion where his head rests to keep him more stable. I open his mouth, and his tongue wags around. His eyes are open, but I don’t think he’s seeing anything. His tongue kept wagging. I run my fingers across his teeth. A part of me hopes he can feel it. My index finger, slowly tracing down his front tooth. He has an overbite, and the bottom row is prominently crooked.<br>
I can still feel XX53 staring, but I don’t care. I’ll never have this chance again. Never. I feel back all the way to where his wisdom teeth would have been. The gums are sore and swollen. He doesn’t floss, I can tell.
</p>

<div class="teeth">
<p>
    <span class="louis big">Your teeth are fucking disgusting.</span><br>
    I press my knee into his ribs, I’m losing balance.<br>
    <span class="louis">You should’ve worn your retainer when you were younger, Joe. Look at this mess.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>
His left bottom canine juts out against the rest of the row, almost completely hiding one of his incisors. Several of his molars have cavities, and I’m getting plaque stuck under my fingernails. I love it. His tongue follows my hands. I push hard on that bottom canine, his body twitches. It hurts. I push again, harder. I grip it with two fingers, pulling, twisting. I’d tear it out if I could. I’ll settle for cutting the gums with my nails.<br>
The jaw opens wider than you’d expect. I stretch it open as wide as I can. I get my whole hand in there, feeling around the back of his throat. He has a rather weak gag reflex too. Didn’t even jerk when I had my hand in there, though he did sputter when I brushed his uvula.<br>
<span class="louis">You’re so gross. My hand’s a mess, just from your mouth. Your TEETH. Look what you did.</span><br>
I wipe plaque and spit across his face, tracing different things against his cheek. Oak’s name, my name, 1021. He looks so funny, with his eyes rolling around. It’s the most expressive I’ve ever seen him. I don’t even think he’s frightened, just confused. He’d be a lot more scared if he knew how much I <br><span class="bigbigbig2">[<span class="redacted bigbigbig2">WANT HIM DEAD</span>].</span><br> <!--He should be scared. He deserves to be scared.<br>-->
I brush my scalpel against his gums. Not cutting. Not cutting. Just marking where I should cut. Where I would cut if I was a worse person, an angrier person. But his body finally relented. His eyes were tearing, and he made the weakest sound. A whimper, almost. 
<span class="big3">GOD.</span><br> 
Finally. Finally. Finally.<br>
<span class="angel big">WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</span><br>
What?<br>
What am I. What am I doing? Oak runs from the doorway, grabbing my arm.<br>
<span class="angel">Get off of him.</span><br>
<span class="louis">I don’t-.</span><br>
<span class="angel">GET OFF AND GET AWAY FROM JOE!</span><br>
I started running. I don’t understand what’s going on. My stomach twists, and I barely made it to the bathroom before it emptied.<br>
I didn’t leave my room all day. I was terrified. I don’t want to get in trouble. I don’t even remember what happened, just that it was bad. No one came to get me, but no one checked in with me either. I don’t know what that means.<br>
It didn’t matter. They were arguing loud enough for me to hear.<br>
<span class="joe">I don’t know what to tell you.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Your teeth are all messed up, your mouth is sore, I saw Garnier on you! There's no other explanation!</span><br>
<span class="joe">Oak. I showed you the footage. We sat together all night. And then we went to bed. YOU didn’t even get up. Camera footage doesn’t lie.</span><br>
<span class="angel">I know what I saw. He was unhinged. He wanted to hurt you! He had his scalpel in your mouth!</span><br>
<span class="joe">You were asleep. YOU WERE ASLEEP. I’ll pull the video up again, you were in bed the WHOLE NIGHT.</span><br>
<span class="angel">STOP GRABBING ME!</span><br>
Oak had stomped off by then. I’m not sure if they made up, but the rest of the day was very quiet.<br>
Since I didn’t have breakfast, I hadn’t had any coffee to keep me up. My body didn’t take it very well. I could feel it setting in, the worst night terror.<br>
The church is lit up by stained glass windows. They were beautiful, the only thing I liked about Sundays. It’s late, just past sunset. My mother only made us attend morning masses, but the priest often had me for evenings. I don’t even remember his name. But we were alone, very often. It was a small church. The other alter boy didn’t give a shit, and his parents were always there to take him home. I had to walk, so I always stayed behind to help clean up.<br>
And it was one of those days, where it was beautiful out. The summer. Hot and sticky. I’m in front of the tabernacle, and he comes behind me. And I know what’s going to happen, I knew it would happen since the first day I met him.<br>

    <span class="bigbigbig2">I THINK I'M GOING TO DIE.</span><br>
    Everything in my body is SCREAMING that I'm rotting around my bones. I wasn't meant to live past Halloween. I'm terrified. I'm terrified. I can't take it anymore I can't take it anymore I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE I'M AT MY LIMITT MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP PLEASE PLEASE DEAR GOD MAKE IT STOP.<br>
    This will pass. This will pass.<br>
    Hey. Listen. This will pass. It will come out soon. It will come out soon. It will come out soon. It will come out soon.<br>
    My hand’s been getting worse. It’ll never be the same again. The pain squirms and moves around. Sometimes it sits up in my ring finger, and I rub Oak’s ring through my sweater. It helps, just a little.<br>
    Oak avoids me completely now. I guess he never made up with Joe, because he refuses to eat with us. But I can tell he’s questioning himself. Cameras don’t lie. When he glances at me, though, there’s fear in his eyes. That’s ok. It will pass. And when it does I’ll give him his ring. And I’ll make him my husband.<br>
    No, no. I’m getting dizzy. I drink coffee whenever I can. My dreams are strange again. I’ve never been so thankful to see Joe’s face in my life. I’ll take him any day over bright lights bright windows bright hands bright hands bright hands BRIGHT HANDS<br>
    Dream Joe’s started holding me. I hate it. He’s so much more brutish in my dreams. He doesn’t think I can take care of myself, so he carries me everywhere. Oak tags along, holding my hand. We’re married. We’re two husbands with a massive, stupid dog. That’s heaven. God, is that heaven.<br>
    Oh it’s a sin, it’s a sin, but I’ve been sneaking down into Lab 10 A at night. Not only does the skeleton there wear his coat size, the fingers fit his ring perfectly. I pose it against my body, dozing off, and I dream of Joe and Oak and I in harmony. A perfect life. We wander the building saying nothing but nonsense.<br>
    The teeth on this skeleton are phenomenal. It’s plastic, but a very smooth one. Not the cheap kind. The kind you’d rub your hands against and melt. I dig my fingers into its ribcage to feel in between each bone. My hands are shaking. When it wears his ring, and I lace our fingers together, my hand finally feels whole again. It feels like my own. I feel like a human being again.<br>
    Forgive me. Please, forgive me. I stole it away to my room for tonight. My hand was aching so bad, I just wanted to feel safe. I keep him in my room now. No one ever noticed it missing, or maybe they just didn’t care.<br>
    I haven’t been keeping up with anything, really. I haven’t even spoken with my beloved XX[REDACTED] in weeks. When I try to go downstairs the corner voices get louder. I think XX53 is still upset I didn’t return his favor.<br>
    I can feel eyes on me. The cameras aren’t just for us. He can see through them. When I look into the lenses, I can feel his eyes.<br>
    He doesn’t have eyes.<br>
    He lost them. He doesn’t have eyes.<br>
    But he can see. I know he can. I can feel it. His stare is heavy, just like Joe’s. Exactly like Joe’s.<br>
    I was in Lab 7 B, preparing a study on XX19 that Joe asked me to set up. I remember distinctly, I had to go downstairs to bring up a fresh sample. But I went down too many flights, somehow, and ended up on the bottom floor. And when I realized it, I felt someone grab my hand.<br>
    <span class="redacted">Lou, Lou!</span><br>
    XX[REDACTED] was holding onto me, pulling me from the stairwell. His gown was all torn up, and his neck was red, but he still had his big smile stretched on his face.<br>
    <span class="redacted">No time, Lou!</span><br>
    <span class="louis">Wh-? You aren’t supposed to be down here? We need to get you back to your room, before anyone catches you outside.</span><br>
    <span class="redacted">No time, no time! Isaac needs you, Lou!</span><br>
    That’s. That’s a complete sentence. He was smiling wide, as if this were normal.<br>
    <span class="redacted">Come onnnnn, Isaac’s gonna kill me if I take any longer, Lou!</span><br>
    <span class="louis">Are you real?</span><br>
    I said it without thinking. But his smile dimmed, and suddenly I felt like I was going to throw up.<br>
    <span class="louis">Hey. Hey, are you real? Hey. Hey? Hey, can you hear me? Are you real? Is this real? Hey? Hey. Hey? Are you listening? Is this real? Are you real?</span><br>
    He finally let go, taking just a step back. And then he held up his hand.<br>
    <span class="redacted">It will come out soon.</span><br>
    Something horrible is going to happen to me. I am going to die in this building. They’ll find me too late. I’ll be decomposing in the walls. And it will be deserved.<br>
    Stop it. Focus. I can barely hear Joe over my own thoughts.<br>
    <span class="joe">I’m really frustrated. Things were starting to get better, I can’t believe he’s done this to you.</span><br>
    <span class="louis">It’s fine. It’ll pass.</span><br>
    <span class="joe">I suppose I should’ve expected it out of him. You know how his type are.</span><br>
    <span class="louis">Type?</span><br>
    <span class="joe">You know.</span><br>
    He does that little wrist shake he always does.<br>
    <span class="joe">They’re prone to hysterics. Just like a woman.</span><br>
    <span class="louis">Ah.</span><br>
    I don’t know what he means by that, but I’m not about to ask. God, I need another drink, but Joe gets in a tizzy when he catches me refilling my flask. I rub my ring through my turtleneck.<br>
There’s no use in hiding it anymore. I’ve stopped drawing on my arm altogether. Joe stopped bringing it up, and I’ll feel eyes on me whether he’s watching me or not. There are always eyes. Always on me. When I can’t wear the ring I tear my arm up, and when I can’t sneak away to do that I pick at my fingers till the cuticle tears. It’s deserved.<br>
My stomach was particularly bad today. Joe was very kind and helped me to the bathroom. He sat with me while I vomited, and I kept trying to make a joke about that time in the stairwell. But whenever I tried, I’d just throw up more. Maybe it’s for the best. It wasn’t that funny to begin with.<br>
Joe, Josef, Doctor Koch, stop being so gentle with me. It won’t change my mind about you. You’re a sick man at heart.<br>
No he’s not. He’s wonderful. A big old dog stuck in his ways. I’d kiss him if his breath wasn’t so fucking disgusting. Eugh. I need water. Coffee is so sweet but I’m getting those headaches again. I think I’m dehydrated.<br>
It’s horrible, it’s a sin, but sometimes when it’s late and I’m heading to the bathroom I like to poke inside Oak’s room. I’m quiet, I was very good at moving around quiet when I was young. My father would beat the shit out of me if I woke him up. He said he would, anyway. I never woke him up, I’m not about to take that chance. I’m 10 years old, he would’ve killed me. He would’ve. He should’ve.<br>
Oak has a beautiful pulse. His wrists are soft but not squishy, you can get a solid read without needing to press too firm. He mutters my name sometimes in his sleep, and he’ll twist and turn, heart racing. His lips are still chapped.<br>
I count his heart beats now when I can’t get to sleep. Teeth just won’t cut it. Mine make me think of Joe. I’ve let myself go too far now. Some mornings he’ll ask Joe if he saw anything strange on the cameras, and he’ll always say no. And he set his phone up on his dresser, recording. I spoke into it, I told it how much I loved him, how excited I was for us to be together. I flipped it down so he knew something happened, but the camera and the microphone never pick a thing up.<br>
<span class="big">Finally.</span><br>
I don’t believe in God, but I do in angels. Biblically accurate angels, with many eyes, with strong convictions and anger towards people like me. You’d know their gaze anywhere. Heavy, filled with vile. They hate me. But I think they’ve given me a gift, just because the end is coming soon.<br>
A lifetime of punishment, conviction, pain. And now, right at the end, they’re letting me enjoy myself, just a little.<br>
All I need is a little. All I need is a little. A taste. A whimper. I’ll ride this to the bitter, vile end.<br>
I was downstairs. Yes, I was downstairs. In the basement, late at night. Or I guess early in the morning. In Lab 10 A. I brought the skeleton back down, because I wanted a quiet, private place where Joe wouldn’t be able to hear me. I can feel his eyes, heavy on me, even when he should be in his room. He listens to me through the walls. I can feel it. I know it.<br>
I had him on the ground, feeling his teeth. Oak’s ring was in my mouth, ground against my teeth. It feels so good, especially against the molars. One of the gems came off, and I don’t know where it went. I don’t care. It made me happy, it was my ring. Maybe it’s inside me. Thrilling. A little bit of him, resting inside me, deep in my stomach. I just hope it stays inside.<br>
<span class="louis">Do you want a taste, darling?</span><br>
The ring looks so beautiful in his mouth. I close the jaw so it’s around his upper canine, and spin it absentmindedly. My stomach hurts, my palm burns, but the pain is thrilling.<br>
<span class="angel">Doctor Garnier-?</span><br>
No. No no no no.<br>
<span class="angel">That’s-! Louis, why do you-?! Oh my god-!</span><br>
The way you always find me, it almost feels like fate. Did you miss my presence? I have a million questions, I do, forgive me. My throat, it’s closing up. I can only sputter out nonsense.<br>
<span class="angel big">WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!</span><br>
<span class="louis">Angel-!</span><br>
Fuck. My, my stomach. He kicked me, as hard as he could, just to pry our ring out of my hands.<br>
<span class="angel">What did you do to it...? I-It’s all wet and scratched up... Were you chewing on it?!</span><br>
I’m going to throw up. Help me, Angel. Please.<br>    
<span class="angel"><i>Don't touch me.</i> I knew it, this whole time you had it! You stole it!</span><br>
<span class="louis">It was a gift-</span><br>
<span class="angel">IT’S MY RING! How the hell did you even get this?! You went through my room, right?</span><br>
<span class="louis">Angel, please-</span><br>
<span class="angel">I don’t know WHAT you’ve been doing to the camera, o-or to Joe. But there’s something wrong with you. You’re rotten.</span><br>
No. No, please. Angel, please.<br>
<span class="angel">Louis. Look at me. Stop-<span class="big4">STOP IT.</span> Get off my leg. Look at me. You need to turn yourself in. Or contact your supervisor, SOMETHING. What you’re doing to me and Joe is sick. You’re hurting yourself, and you’re hurting us.</span><br>
<span class="louis">All you ever do is talk about him.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Oh my god- LOUIS. Be an adult. You’re freaking out over a rejection? That’s what all of this has been about?</span><br>
<span class="louis">You said we’d. You said we’d talk about it later.</span><br>
<span class="angel">We WERE going to. You think I’m going to want anything to do with you after all the shit you’ve done?! You’re ROTTEN.</span><br>
My ears are ringing.<br>
<span class="lord tran">Angel.</span><br>
<span class="angel">Now get off me.</span><br>
I’m on the floor, keeping my lips tight pressed. I swallow a heap of bile, and my throat is burning.<br>
<span class="louis">I think I’m in love with you.</span><br>
<span class="angel bigbigbig">FUCK OFF.</span><br>
Don’t go. Don’t leave me. Please. Please. He’s out the doorway, running. Flying.<br>
And I went downstairs, because my angel wasn’t in bed.<br>
And I was downstairs.<br>
And he was in the stairwell, wide eyed, terrified even.<br>
Angel, please. My throat hurts.<br>
What bliss, to see you Angel.<br>
Crawling, whimpering, trying not to vomit.<br>
<span class="angel">What...?</span>

<p>
Deuteronomy 22:23-24. When my father was upset with me, instead of time out he would sit me in his bedroom and have me read the bible. Even at that age there were so many stories that confused me. I remember one always stood out to me. It was a simple few lines, but it was so often the one I would hit before he would unlock the door. If a man were to steal away another’s wife and rape her, you would stone them both. The man for rape, and the woman for not crying for help in the city.<br>
But what if the woman did cry for help? What if no one came to save her, no matter how loud she cried? Would you still stone her? What if it were a little child? A man on a man? Would you stone them?<br>
Sometimes, you do cry. And you scream. And maybe people are around. And you can hear them upstairs. They don’t come to save you. Maybe they’re just excited for another stone tossing. I am. I certainly am.<br>
<span class="joe">Have you seen Oak this morning?</span><br>
<span class="louis">No.</span><br>
<span class="joe">I can't find him.</span><br>
<span class="louis">He’s somewhere in the building. Did you check security footage?</span><br>
I rub our ring through my turtleneck.<br>
<span class="joe">He went into the basement in the middle of the night. But, he just. Stops showing up. He enters the stairwell, and then he’s nowhere on the footage. I-. I don’t know what that means.</span><br>
<span class="louis">He’s somewhere in the building. It’ll be fine.</span><br>
Joe just sits in his office, watching back the footage. Sometimes he’ll leave to search his room, and on the rare day he’ll search the basement. Like a lost puppy, searching for his owner who abandoned him.<br>
We are now one. Two bodies in union. I wish I could wear our ring, but it’s much too dangerous. I know we’re together, though. That’s all that matters to me.<br>
The eyes never leave me, but they’re kinder. XX53 must have liked his gift. He was kind enough to let me. To.<br>
I’m starving.<br>
I rub my fingers against his molar, beautiful white teeth. I was only allowed to keep one. One tooth, one eye, one finger. And our bodies could be one. Whole, I’m a whole human again. My angel completes me.<br>
This whole project is running into the ground. I’ve missed so many calls from Diane, and I think Joe unplugged the phone from his office. Keith and Kevin and Brian are always running around upstairs. I hear them through the walls, they talk about jumping ship before it’s too late. There’s no escaping this building, though, and I think they know it.<br>
There is escape under unity.<br>
<span class="lord">Escape under submission.</span><br>
<span class="louis">Escape under the eyes of an angel.</span><br>
Under the skin. Under the skin. Under the skin.<br>
My hand is festering, and I’ve stopped changing the bandage. Instead I cut around it, through it. Pushing the scalpel through gauze to skin to MUSCLE makes my legs weak. Every part of me screams. There’s no use in hiding it anymore. They all know. They all know.<br>
<span class="big4"><i>FUCK.</i></span> Keep digging.<br>
The pain grows worse every day. Not in intensity; in restlessness. It vibrates, it pulsates, running up my arm to my neck to my eyes, then back down again to the tips of my fingers. I’m trying to catch it. I’ll skewer it. I’ll tear it out from it’s roots and cut it in half.<br>
<span class="big4"><i>FUCK.</i></span> Fuck. It’s too fast. My head is buzzing, and I’m out of coffee.<br>
<span class="lord">Keep digging.</span><br>
It’s coming, I can feel it. The end. It’s inevitable. <span class="big4"><i>HARDER.</i></span><br>
<span class="bigbigbig2"><i>FUCK.</i></span><br>
<span class="big4"><i>Fuck. Ah. Ah.</i></span><br>
I. I got it. It’s squirming, caught on my blade. Alive.<br>
